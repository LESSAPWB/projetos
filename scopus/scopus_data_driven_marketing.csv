85191180283,Developing customer analytics capability in firms of different ages: Examining the complementarity of outside-in and inside-out resources,Mehrabi H.,Industrial Marketing Management,2024-05-01,10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.04.009,0,Kingston Business School,Article,"© 2024 The AuthorsCustomer analytics capability remains underdeveloped among firms despite its potential for enhancing competitiveness. Previous research has predominantly focused on inside-out organizational factors as drivers of customer analytics capability. This paper examines the role of outside-in resource, the complementarity between outside-in and inside-out resources, and their boundary conditions. Specifically, we study how customer orientation culture (an outside-in resource) complements data-driven culture (an inside-out resource) in firms of different ages to drive customer analytics capability and subsequently, firm performance. Using survey data obtained from Canadian firms, we find that customer orientation is not only positively related to customer analytics capability but also reinforces the effect of data-driven culture. We further find that the conditional effect of customer orientation becomes stronger as firm age increases. In particular, among older firms, the impact of data-driven culture is greatest when customer orientation is high, but it becomes nonsignificant when customer orientation is low. We also link these relationships to firm performance using mediation and moderated mediation analyses. Overall, the results suggest that achieving customer analytics excellence and resultant competitive performance requires marketing to continuously act as customer champions and advocate data analytics efforts to ensure the firm embraces an outside-in orientation."

Indeed, even when companies recognize the value of IIoT, they do not necessarily know how to grasp related opportunities and are challenged in developing a suitable business model. Accordingly, to alleviate roadblocks to capturing value from IIoT, in this paper we address the challenge of identifying suitable business models in the age of the industrial metaverse. We do so through an extensive review and classification of main IIoT business model archetypes that are successful in practice. In particular, we conduct a content analysis of IIoT projects based on over 2000 articles in industry trade magazines and newspapers. Our analysis identifies four distinct business model archetypes in the context of IIoT, viz. IIoT digical, IIoT service-centered, IIoT data-driven, and IIoT platform, and further explores the challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that companies can capture value from their IIoT initiatives. We explore appropriate contexts for these business model archetypes, and, in doing so, we provide actionable guidance for industrial (marketing) managers seeking to position their IIoT offerings and maximize their value."

We develop a data-driven approach to collect and analyse tasks that users are asking to generative LLMs. Thanks to the focus on tasks this paper contributes to give a quantitative and granular understanding of the potential influence of LLMs in different business areas. Utilizing a dataset comprising over 3.8 million tweets, we identify and cluster 31,747 unique tasks, with a specific case study on ChatGPT. To reach this goal, the proposed method combines two Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and BERTopic. The combination makes it possible to collect granular tasks of LLMs (NER) and clusters them in business areas (BERTopic). Our findings reveal a wide spectrum of applications, from programming assistance to creative content generation, highlighting LLM's versatility. The analysis highlighted six emerging areas of application for ChatGPT: human resources, programming, social media, office automation, search engines, education. The study also examines the implications of these findings for innovation management, proposing a research agenda to explore the intersection of the identified areas, with four stages of the innovation process: idea generation, screening/idea selection, development, and diffusion/sales/marketing."
85188689332,Mathematical analysis of big data analytics under bipolar complex fuzzy soft information,Jan N.,Applied Soft Computing,2024-05-01,10.1016/j.asoc.2024.111481,1,Korea National University of Transportation,Article,"© 2024 Elsevier B.V.The aim of this study is to develop new and efficient theories for handling complex and unreliable data in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach integrates two distinct theories: the Bipolar Complex Fuzzy Set (BCFS) and the Soft Set (SS), resulting in a novel and superior method compared to existing solutions. Furthermore, the value of big data analytics cannot be overstated as it provides businesses with the opportunity to use their data to find areas for development and progress. To gain insights from raw data, it must first be collected and organized. Data modeling represents these large, complex data sets in a visual format, such as a chart or diagram. However, the visualization process often results in uncertainties and inaccuracies, highlighting the need for a more robust approach to data analysis. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of Bipolar Complex Fuzzy Soft Relations (BCFSRs), a fuzzy decision-making method within a complex bipolar fuzzy environment that can have the advantages of both a Bipolar Complex fuzzy relation and a soft relation at the same time. In BCFSRs, an element can have degrees of membership in both the positive and negative directions, reflecting a more nuanced and versatile representation of uncertainty or ambiguity. These mathematical ideas are explained through the Cartesian product of two Bipolar Complex Fuzzy Soft Sets (BCFSSs) and serve to simplify the decision-making process by presenting the BCFSSs in a clear and concise manner. The inventive notion of the BCFSRs elucidates the combined positive and negative effects of anything with parameterization. To support organizations in making data-driven choices and obtain insights for strategic planning and inventiveness, the analysis of big data is essential in several industries, including financial services, marketing, and medical treatment, among others. To choose the optimal big data analytics for efficient operation, this research presents modeling methodologies based on BCFSRs, including the formulation and analysis of scoring functions. The validity of the proposed work is demonstrated through a comparison study with existing methods, providing valuable insights for effective data analysis."
85182892371,GNN-IR: Examining graph neural networks for influencer recommendations in social media marketing,Park J.,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,2024-05-01,10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.103705,1,University of Toronto,Article,"© 2024 Elsevier LtdWith the notable growth of the Internet, a number of platforms have emerged and attracted an enormous number of users. Based on the impact of these platforms, some ‘influencers’ are highlighted. These influencers wield significant power, shaping consumer behavior. This influence spawned the concept of influencer marketing, where companies leverage these personalities to advertise their products. YouTube stands out as a prominent platform in this trend. However, considering the limited number of influencers and their concepts, the majority of companies, which hope to conduct their marketing campaigns with influencers face challenges in identifying suitable influencers for their campaigns. With this trend, we introduce GNN-IR, a graph neural network for influencer recommendation, based on the connections between companies and influencers of YouTube, one of the largest content platforms. In developing GNN-IR, we adopted a data-driven methodology utilizing a meticulously curated dataset collected in-house. Our dataset comprises a total of 25,174 relationship entries between advertisers and influencers, involving 1,886 distinct advertisers and 3,812 unique YouTube influencers. It encompasses diverse data modalities, including images, text, and assorted metadata. The data was sourced from two primary platforms: YouTube and ugwanggi. Ugwanggi provided valuable insights into the relationships between advertisers and influencers via their information. Meanwhile, YouTube offered more comprehensive and detailed influencer-centric information. We employed PyTorch Geometric to construct a bipartite graph representing interconnected data. Our recommendation system operates via link prediction, suggesting the Top-k influencers to advertisers based on the calculated connection probability between nodes. To assess GNN-IR's performance, we employed a range of evaluation metrics. For link prediction, we measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Additionally, in the recommendation phase, we evaluated Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score@k. Using GNN-IR and incorporating profile images from YouTube, keyword features, metadata, and sentiment gleaned from YouTube comments, we achieved Precision levels of 96.51% at k=1 and 93.68% at k=10. Based on the experimental results, several implications and limitations are presented. The collected dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/dxlabskku/GNN-IR.git."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.As video platforms such as Douyin, also known as TikTok's Chinese version, continue to grow, there is an increasing interest in the study of green advertising videos to understand their audiovisual features and their impact on audience engagement. In this research, we specifically focus on green advertising within the automotive industry. Drawing on literature from sustainability, green advertising, and communication studies, we identified seven audiovisual aspects and three persuasive strategies pertinent to green automotive advertising videos. Utilizing a mixed-methods video analysis framework, we analyzed a dataset of 2,553 green automotive advertising videos on Douyin over three years from 15 June 2020 to 15 June 2023. These videos exhibited higher loudness, a faster pace, and longer durations compared to their non-green counterparts. We categorized three distinct types of green advertising videos on Douyin and established that specific audiovisual features and persuasive strategies are significantly correlated with audience engagement levels. This study not only delineates the audiovisual characteristics of green automotive advertising in China's digital space but also contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable marketing practices on social networks like TikTok. The findings extend image-centric research to video content and provide marketers with data-driven insights for crafting effective content creation strategies on Douyin."
85188859621,Consumer-side fairness in recommender systems: a systematic survey of methods and evaluation,Vassøy B.,Artificial Intelligence Review,2024-04-01,10.1007/s10462-023-10663-5,0,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Article,"© The Author(s) 2024.In the current landscape of ever-increasing levels of digitalization, we are facing major challenges pertaining to data volume. Recommender systems have become irreplaceable both for helping users navigate the increasing amounts of data and, conversely, aiding providers in marketing products to interested users. Data-driven models are susceptible to data bias, materializing in the bias influencing the models’ decision-making. For recommender systems, such issues are well exemplified by occupation recommendation, where biases in historical data may lead to recommender systems relating one gender to lower wages or to the propagation of stereotypes. In particular, consumer-side fairness, which focuses on mitigating discrimination experienced by users of recommender systems, has seen a vast number of diverse approaches. The approaches are further diversified through differing ideas on what constitutes fair and, conversely, discriminatory recommendations. This survey serves as a systematic overview and discussion of the current research on consumer-side fairness in recommender systems. To that end, a novel taxonomy based on high-level fairness definitions is proposed and used to categorize the research and the proposed fairness evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight some suggestions for the future direction of the field."

Given the essential role played by B2B marketing departments in new product and service development, this paper takes an abductive approach to elucidate how the data-driven innovation capability of marketing can be constructed by identifying its constituent elements and underlying processes. It draws upon the existing literature on digital marketing capabilities applied to innovation and 17 in-depth interviews with B2B managers. The paper proposes a capability model for the data-driven innovation capability of marketing that articulates building blocks according to three major phases: (1) ideation, (2) analysis, and (3) deployment. It reveals the resources and competencies for operationalizing three successive routines to: (1) generate a knowledge ecosystem, (2) disseminate data-driven insights, and (3) design an answer. Each routine is facilitated by three distinct learning mechanisms that (1) capture, (2) articulate, and (3) codify, throughout the innovation phases. Furthermore, potential enablers and consequences are identified to offer an overall process-oriented framework. This study provides valuable guidance to marketing managers by determining the critical resources, routines, and learning mechanisms for engaging in data-driven innovation."

Given the scale and speed of digital disruption in today’s industry, marketing academics face ongoing challenges of addressing the theory–practice gap, which will only accelerate. The purpose of the current study is to gain a better understanding of the current state of digital/social media marketing and analytics education through a review of past pedagogical research in the realm of digital/social media marketing and marketing analytics. The collected database (N = 54) was analyzed based on their category and scope, and sub-themes within each category. Our findings indicate that while business schools have been diligent in introducing important skill sets to their curriculum, the approach has been predominately tactical, rather than driven by an overarching strategic plan. Based on the findings, we discuss the implications for marketing educators and directions for future research that can help bridge the theory–practice gap as we proceed in the future data-driven digital environments."
85189242944,The Data Product-service Composition Frontier: A Hybrid Learning Approach,Quattrocchi G.,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,2024-03-23,10.1145/3649319,0,Politecnico di Milano,Article,"© 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.The service dominant logic is a base concept behind modern economies and software products, with service composition being a well-known practice for companies to gain a competitive edge over others by joining differentiated services together, typically assembled according to a number of features. At the other end of the spectrum, product compositions are a marketing device to sell products together in bundles that often augment the value for the customer, e.g., with suggested product interactions, sharing, and so on. Unfortunately, currently each of these two streams - namely, product and service composition - are carried out and delivered individually in splendid isolation: anything is being offered as a product and as a service, disjointly. We argue that the next wave of services computing features more and more service fusion with physical counterparts as well as data around them. Therefore a need emerges to investigate the interactive engagement of both (data) products and services. This manuscript offers a real-life implementation in support of this argument, using (1) genetic algorithms (GA) to shape product-service clusters, (2) end-user feedback to make the GAs interactive with a data-driven fashion, and (3) a hybridized approach which factors into our solution an ensemble machine-learning method considering additional features. All this research was conducted in an industrial environment. With such a cross-fertilized, data-driven, and multi-disciplinary approach, practitioners from both fields may benefit from their mutual state of the art as well as learn new strategies for product, service, and data product-service placement for increased value to the customer as well as the service provider. Results show promise but also highlight plenty of avenues for further research."

85152266844,Growth hacking and international dynamic marketing capabilities: a conceptual framework and research propositions,Bargoni A.,International Marketing Review,2024-03-05,10.1108/IMR-07-2022-0156,6,Università degli Studi di Torino,Article,"© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Few studies have conceptualized how companies can build and nurture international dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMCs) by implementing growth hacking strategies. This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice. Hence, this study could stimulate researchers to deepen the phenomenon and empirically validate the propositions."

However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper."

As the customer base grows, insurance companies must prioritize transitioning to data-driven strategies to cut costs and make more informed marketing choices in today's digital era. This study proposes a new decision-making framework for precision marketing, based on a real case study from a Moroccan insurance company that aims to solve a practical problem. The proposed decision-making system consists of four components, with each component involving important steps. Firstly, data preparation was performed, consisting of four critical stages: data acquisition, data cleaning and filtering, feature selection, and oversampling. Secondly, top 20% and top 50% consumers are taken as examples to present their customer persona in detail. Based on the processed data, we analysed consumer consumption behaviors using four ML algorithms and made a performance comparison of the four algorithms. Additionally, we conducted feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features and evaluate the system's performance. The aim of the proposed precision decision-making system is to assist managers in discerning the distinctive characteristics of potential customers and proposing tailored precision marketing strategies. This approach is expected to substantially reduce advertising expenses and enhance overall marketing efficiency. A case study using real-world data from a Moroccan insurance company was conducted to demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed framework. The results of the study indicate that the proposed system yielded favourable outcomes."

85186543148,A data-driven approach to improve online consumer subscriptions by combining data visualization and machine learning methods,Fernandes E.,International Journal of Consumer Studies,2024-03-01,10.1111/ijcs.13030,1,Iscte – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa,Article,"© 2024 The Authors. International Journal of Consumer Studies published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Effective online consumer research helps companies on defining a successful strategy to increase user loyalty and shape brand engagement. Digital innovation introduced a dramatic change in businesses, particularly in the online news industry. Content consumers have a wide offer across different channels which increase the digital challenge for online news media companies to retain their readers and convert them into online subscribers. Furthermore, digital news publishers often strive to balance revenue sources in online business models. Thus, this study fills a gap in the literature on media consumer research by proposing a data-driven approach that combines two machine learning (ML) models to allow managers dynamically improve their marketing and editorial strategies. Firstly, the authors present an online user profiling to identify consumer segments based on the interplay between several engagement’ variables substantiated in the literature research. Second, as few studies have explored the factors influencing users' intention to pay for such services, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting ML algorithm identifies the predictors of consumer's willingness to pay. Third, a dashboard presents the key performance indicators across the audience funnel. Thus, practical implications and business suggestions are presented in a two-fold strategy to maximize revenue from digital subscriptions and advertising. Findings provide new insights into an engagement approach and the relation to acquire a digital subscription in online content platforms. We believe that the provided recommendations are potentially useful to help marketing and editorial teams to manage their customer engagement process across the funnel in a more efficient way."

Attribution modeling is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of different channels and adjusting budgets accordingly. However, current models lack the level of sophistication that marketers need to trust the results. In this study, in partnership with MASS Analytics, we use real-world data from a B2C e-commerce store in the Middle East and North Africa region, including data on 348,078 customer journeys over 6 months and 2,683 journeys over 2 months. We develop data-driven Bayesian network attribution models that (1) properly address the natural imbalance in the datasets; (2) can be used to predict the conversion probabilities in real-time within an acceptable accuracy level of 0.9537; and (3) measure the channel attributions using a novel negative observation propagation technique within the Bayesian network model. Empirical results using a real-world dataset of an e-commerce website are quite promising. Furthermore, our principal contributions consist of the following: As a categorization and prediction tool, we present a Bayesian network model that gives marketers the power to identify the most effective channels for future consumer engagement and conversions. We use a novel method for channel attribution in the Bayesian network model that makes use of negative observation propagation. We also provide a new algorithm that aims to maximize attribution results and give marketers more insightful data to assess and refine their tactics."
85181735917,Growth hacking: A critical review to clarify its meaning and guide its practical application,Bargoni A.,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2024-03-01,10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123111,1,Università degli Studi di Torino,Article,"© 2023 The AuthorsThere is an increasing recognition among academics and practitioners that growth hacking provides a means to bridge the gap between strategy definition and strategy implementation. Significant tensions tend to arise across this gap. However, the data-driven experimentation, and the organizational capabilities developed within the firm, increase the ability of the company to foster technological forecasting and business model innovation. It is argued within this paper, that growth hacking actually mitigates these tensions. This paper is a critical review complemented with insights from practitioners and an illustrative case, the purpose of which is to: a) shed light on what growth hacking is; b) give practical tips on how to implement growth hacking. In achieving the first goal, the paper unravels the following myths. First, growth hacking is not a framework for platforms and high-tech companies only. Second, it is not only a marketing strategy and third, that growth hacking is a predefined process. These issues are traced back to two flawed assumptions underlying growth hacking; namely that (a) it is a framework designed for start-ups only and (b) that a “one size fits all” approach to growth hacking is appropriate. By unravelling those issues and combining these observations we shall provide ground for a fundamentally different approach to growth hacking, designed for business model scalability, enabled for adaptability in a changing business environment and focused throughout on the effective management of a firm's resources and capabilities. These insights shall guide scholars towards a better understanding of the phenomenon and of the two waves that characterize its evolution, providing also promising future research avenues. Moreover, the implications drawn from the discussion shall help managers in guiding their journey from strategy definition to strategy implementation."

Previous research has paid attention to exploring the influence of marketing analytics on business performance, and rarely examined how the use of marketing analytics influences customer agility and satisfaction. According to the dynamic capabilities view and using previous studies, we developed a conceptual framework to explore the effect of marketing analytics use on customer agility and customer satisfaction. In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a three-wave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction. The findings suggest that researchers should look beyond direct effects of marketing analytics use and shift their attention on how a marketing analytics can be leveraged to enable and support dynamic capabilities and customer satisfaction."

In this study, a concept that has been implemented in business-to-business marketing at IBM is taken over to procurement in the automotive industry to provide decision support. Thereby, this work builds on information processing theory to utilize artificial intelligence technologies, i.e., natural language processing and supervised learning to augment the skills of buyers, whereby design principles were derived for information technology providers and procurement organizations in private and public settings worldwide. As a key finding, overall, Mini Batch K-means was the most performative model among the selected clustering algorithms. Furthermore, through actively making use of purchasing requisition data typically available in enterprise resource planning systems, the bundling generator artifact can lead to significant improvements in strategic planning and commodity management resulting in better utilization of buyer's capacities, tender designs, and thus procurement's value contribution in the transformation toward industry 4.0. The empirical study contributes to the literature on bundling and spend analysis, which has predominantly relied on historical data. By incorporating requisition data, which poses inherent challenges of precision and information-richness, this work expands this traditional approach with a forward-looking perspective."
85176385096,Contract design considering data driven marketing: with and without the cap and trade regulation,Zhang J.,Annals of Operations Research,2024-02-01,10.1007/s10479-023-05678-8,0,Tianjin University,Article,"© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.Due to the natural advantage of data acquisition, data driven marketing (DDM) has been widely adopted online. The major concern of managers, especially when facing severe environmental issues, is to adjust proper measures regarding DDM promotions (including consumers’ DDM preference and offline free riding), so as to ensure efficient implementation of the cap and trade regulation (CTR). We developed two models: No-CTR and CTR under centralized and decentralized scenarios, and then proposed corresponding contracts to achieve Pareto improvement. The validity of both coordination schemes has been demonstrated. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the results indicate that encouraging DDM promotions and consumers’ environmental awareness are not always beneficial to the manufacturer or retailers. Certain conditions should be met based on promotions and wholesale price. Secondly, comparing No-CTR with CTR, promotions should be set for different carbon quotas to ensure all members prefer CTR. Especially, when carbon quota is moderate, below a certain level can also be optimal. Furthermore, numerical analysis suggests that with the increase of carbon trading price, the online quantity will evolve from downward to upward, as will both retailers’ profit. Entrepreneurs should be mindful of balancing the trade-offs contingent on DDM promotion effect because it plays an essential role in CTR implementation efficiency. In our model, stochastic demand is also considered."

85192101622,The impact of ambidextrous traditional and contemporary data analytics on marketing innovation,Gnizy I.,Journal of Marketing Analytics,2024-01-01,10.1057/s41270-024-00316-z,0,Ono Academic College,Article,"© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.Businesses today operate in a digital transformation era which relates to accumulation of internet-based technologies that reshape how companies derive insights that affect innovation. With the spread of technologies, managers face dilemmas how to relate to existing technologies. One prominent contemporary technology is big data (BD). While research articulates its importance, it ignores its combination with existing traditional systems (i.e., small data; SD) and how firms cultivate this development. This study examines the impact of SD, BD that constitute marketing analytics, and their intersected relationship on data-driven insights en route implications on marketing innovation. Based on quantitative and qualitative studies and ambidexterity framework, the study proposes the combination of SD and BD (data ambidexterity) as key driver of marketing insights and innovation. A conceptual model was tested using regressions, path analyses, and robustness checks. Findings show that new data technologies should not overshadow older ones and suggest a hierarchy of analytic effects (SD < BD < SD × BD). While BD has a stronger effect than SD on insights, their combination is more beneficial than each in isolation. Moreover, the effect of this combination on marketing innovation is mediated through data-driven insights. The study addresses the paucity of research on SD and BD, proposes a more holistic approach, extends the potential of marketing analytics, and exhibits theoretical and practical implications of data ambidexterity."

Computational analysis and statistical modeling show how the testing of theoretical assumptions through categorized data may lead to evidence-based interpretations of patterns of data clustering and to the detection of new communicative aims and conventions across digital media. Preliminary findings reveal indeed significant differences in the frequency of tag (co)patternings and use of visual strategies across channels that are related to the role and aim of each channel in the marketing funnel of persuasion and journey toward purchase (AIDA). Instagram imagery was demonstrated to foster a pre-consumption of the travel experience and emotionally charged reactions by representing perceptive and emotive expectations. While both channels play on postmodern tourists' desire for the uncontaminated, remote and the authentic, Instagram favors aerial views of pristine, aesthetically pleasant settings, often complemented with rear views of solitary individuals performing static processes of contemplation of natural wonders. This suggests a focus on attracting the attention and providing instant gratification of the senses by representing what stands in contrast to everyday life and traditional tourist experiences, both avoiding cognitive effort in a pervasive digital sphere with endless sources of information and encouraging further exploration on websites."

To a large degree, prior research has attributed such differences to the human factor. Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning what impact competencies of key personnel have on generating value from BA initiatives, and to what extent such outcomes complement a firm’s investment in BA. To examine these questions, this study explores the complementary relationship between BA capabilities and π-shaped skills. It posits that the concurrent presence of both indirectly influences innovation outcomes by fostering a data-driven culture. We build on a sample of 185 individuals with supervisory positions in Turkey to unpack this process. The findings revealed that BA capabilities and π-shaped skills influence a firm’s data-driven culture, which in turn impacts the firms’ marketing innovation, and subsequently its innovative performance. That is, data-driven culture and firms’ marketing innovation are relevant underlying serial mechanisms by which BA capabilities and π-shaped skills influence innovative performance."
85183376217,Deep Learning-Based Prediction and Revenue Optimization for Online Platform User Journeys,Wang T.C.,Quantitative Finance and Economics,2024-01-01,10.3934/QFE.2024001,0,National Taiwan University,Article,"© 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.In today’s digital landscape, businesses must allocate online resources efficiently. Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers."

However, the forthcoming widespread uptake of sustainable energy technologies – such as rooftop solar, batteries, heat pumps and electric vehicles – by residential customers also represents a chance for local utilities to diversify their service portfolio. To appropriately market these technologies to households, utilities need data on consumers. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven service bundle recommendation model incorporating technologies and tariffs for residential customers based on individual household data. We validate the model in a case study and quantify the utility of sharing different levels of household data. We find substantial synergies of flexible sustainable technologies and time-varying tariffs, leading to higher cost reductions for customers than tariff-switching alone that can be recommended based on easy-to-obtain data. This demonstrates a large potential for energy service bundle marketing by local utilities. The presented Machine Learning recommendation models enable more reliable recommendations than a naive benchmark. Our research thus demonstrates the potential of data-driven utility marketing strategies that focus on service bundling and the integration of customers’ energy consumption data."

All rights reserved.Given the limitations of traditional theater production processes, which heavily rely on expert experience and manual labor, the theater industry faces a pressing demand for a transition from a paradigm primarily rooted in individual expertise and traditional competencies to one that harnesses intelligent technology and data-driven approaches. This transition aims to enhance production and operational efficiency while elevating artistic expression to address the diverse preferences of audiences more effectively. Within this context, this paper proposes the concept of “parallel theaters”, specifically designed to facilitate collaborative human-machine creativity and intelligent management across the entire theater workflow. By establishing a comprehensive theater model, creating a computational experimentation platform for theatrical art and enabling a virtual-to-real feedback loop, the “parallel theaters” contributes to the intelligent and automated design and execution of critical theater production and management aspects, such as script writing, stage design, performance coordination, audience engagement and marketing. In addition, the paper explores the potential cross-disciplinary applications of “parallel theaters” in education and psychotherapy, analyzing its ability to foster the integration of the theater industry with other fields, thereby expanding the influence of the performing arts. As an avant-garde model for theater creation and management, “parallel theaters” opens new avenues for the industry in the intelligence era, promising enhanced efficiency, enriched artistic expression and a more diverse audience engagement."

In particular, massive pre-emptive depopulation of all poultry within a certain distance has raised concerns regarding animal welfare and food security. Thus, alternative approaches to reducing unnecessary depopulation, such as risk-based depopulation, are highly demanded. This paper proposes a data-driven method to generate a rule table and risk score for each farm to identify preventive measures against HPAI. To evaluate the proposed method, 105 cases of HPAI occurring in a total of 381 farms in Jeollanam-do from 2014 to 2023 were evaluated. The accuracy of preventive measure identification was assessed for each case using both the conventional culling method and the proposed data-driven method. The evaluation showed that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 84.19%, significantly surpassing the previous 10.37%. The result was attributed to the proposed method reducing the false-positive rate by 83.61% compared with the conventional method, thereby enhancing the reliability of identification. The proposed method is expected to be utilized in selecting farms for monitoring and management of HPAI."

Segmentation, which means dividing the population into subgroups (segments) with similar sociodemographic characteristics, is a useful approach for allocating support resources to the targeted segments. Clustering is a commonly used statistical method of segmentation in a data-driven marketing approach. This explanatory sequential mixed methods study applied a clustering technique, aiming to identify segments among older public assistance recipients quantitatively, and assess the meaningfulness of the identified segments in consultation and support activities for older recipients qualitatively. Methods: We identified the segments of older recipients in two municipalities using probabilistic latent semantic analysis, a machine learning-based soft clustering method. Semi-structured interviews were subsequently conducted with caseworkers to ask whether the identified segments could be meaningful for them in practice and to provide a reason if they could not think of any older recipients from the segment. Results: A total of 3,165 older people on public assistance were included in the analysis. Five distinct segments of older recipients were identified for each sex from 1,483 men and 1,682 women. The qualitative findings suggested most of identified segments reflected older recipients in practice, especially two of them: female Cluster 1 (facility residents aged over 85 years with disability/psychiatric disorder), and female Cluster 2 (workers). Some caseworkers, however, did not recall older recipients in practice when working with certain segments. Conclusions: A clustering technique can be useful to identify the meaningful segments among older recipients and can potentially discover previously unrecognized segments that may not emerge through regular consultation practices followed by caseworkers. Future research should investigate whether tailored support interventions for these identified segments are effective."

Almost every business promotes itself through social media, and an educational institution is no different. The users’ responses to social media posts are crucial to a successful promotional campaign. An adverse reaction leaves a long-term negative impact on the audience, and the conversion rate falls. This is why selecting the content to share on social media is one of the most effective decisions behind the success of a campaign. This paper proposes a Data-Driven Promotional Management System (DPMS) for universities to guide the selection of appropriate content to promote on social media, which is more likely to obtain positive user reactions. The main objective of DPMS is to make effective decisions for Social Media Marketing (SMM). The novel DPMS uses a well-engineered and optimized BiLSTM network, classifying users’ sentiments about different university divisions, with a stunning accuracy of 98.66%. The average precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score of the DPMS are 98.12%, 98.24%, 99.39%, and 98.18%, respectively. This innovative Promotional Management System (PMS) increases the positive impression by 68.75%, reduces the adverse reaction by 31.25%, and increases the conversion rate by 18%. In a nutshell, the proposed DPMS is the first promotional management system for universities. It demonstrates significant potential for improving the brand value of universities and for increasing the intake rate."

It can also assist businesses in making data-driven decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer service. However, as social media information continues to grow exponentially, and industry demands increase, sentiment analysis should no longer be limited to fundamental polarity classification of positive, neutral, and negative. Instead, it should move to more precise classification of emotions. Therefore, in this paper, we expand sentiment analysis to analysis of eight different emotions based on Plutchik's wheel of emotions, and define it as a multi-label classification task to identify complex and mixed emotions in text. We achieved an overall precision of 0.7958 for the eight emotions multi-label classification based on the attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory with convolution layer (AC-BiLSTM) model on the SemEval-2018 dataset. In addition, we proposed the introduction of the NRC emotion lexicon and emotion correlation constraints to optimise the emotion classification results. This ultimately increased the overall precision to 0.8228 demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we store and visualise the emotion analysis results in a graph structure, in order to achieve deductibility and traceability of emotions."

Existing optimal power flow (OPF) solution methods need to be enhanced to guarantee the solution optimality and feasibility in real-time operation under such uncertainties. This paper proposes a convex constrained soft actor-critic (CC-SAC) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for the AC-OPF problem. First, this problem is standardized as a Markov decision process model to be solved by DRL algorithms. Second, the operational constraints are satisfied by a novel convex safety layer based on the penalty convex-concave procedure (P-CCP). Then, the control policy is updated by the state-of-the-art off-policy entropy maximization-based SAC algorithm. Therefore, the CC-SAC is a combination of data-driven and physics-driven approaches. The former speedups the solution time by predicting near-optimum control actions through a deep neural network. The latter effectively guarantees the solution feasibility. Simulation results demonstrate the computational performance of the proposed CC-SAC to effectively find AC-OPF decisions with no constraint violation, zero optimality gap and high speed up to 34 times compared to a state-of-the-art solver. The proposed approach indicates its practicability for power system real-time operation and marketing."

This paper introduces a groundbreaking approach, DeepLimeSeg, which synergizes DL methodologies with Lime-based Explainability to segment customers effectively. The approach employs a comprehensive mathematical model to harness demographic data, behavioral patterns, and purchase histories, categorizing customers into distinct clusters aligned with their preferences and needs. A pivotal component of this research is the mathematical underpinning of the DeepLimeSeg approach. The Lime-based Explainability module ensures that the segmentation results are accurate and interpretable. The mathematical rigor facilitates businesses tailoring their marketing strategies with precision, optimizing sales outcomes. To validate the efficacy of DeepLimeSeg, we employed two real-world datasets: Mall-Customer Segmentation Data and an E-Commerce dataset. A comparative analysis between DeepLimeSeg and the traditional Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis is presented. The RFM analysis, grounded in its mathematical modeling, segments customers based on purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value. Our preprocessing involved computing RFM scores for each customer, followed by K-means clustering to delineate customer segments. Empirical results underscored the superiority of DeepLimeSeg over other models in terms of MSE, MAE, and (Formula presented.) metrics. Specifically, the model registered an MSE of 0.9412, indicative of its robust predictive accuracy concerning the spending score. The MAE value stood at 0.9874, signifying minimal deviation from actual values. This paper accentuates the importance of mathematical modeling in enhancing customer segmentation. The DeepLimeSeg approach, with its mathematical foundation and explainable AI integration, paves the way for businesses to make informed, data-driven marketing decisions."

Market segmentation is a crucial marketing strategy that involves identifying and defining distinct groups of buyers to target a company’s marketing efforts effectively. To achieve this, the use of data to estimate consumer preferences and behavior is both appropriate and adequate. Visual elements, such as color and shape, in advertising can effectively communicate the product or service being promoted and influence consumer perceptions of its quality. Similarly, a person’s outward appearance plays a pivotal role in nonverbal communication, significantly impacting human social interactions and providing insights into individuals’ emotional states. In this study, we introduce an innovative deep learning model capable of predicting one of the styles in the seven universal styles model. By employing various advanced deep learning techniques, our models automatically extract features from full-body images, enabling the identification of style-defining traits in clothing subjects. Among the models proposed, the XCEPTION-based approach achieved an impressive top accuracy of 98.27%, highlighting its efficacy in accurately predicting styles. Furthermore, we developed a personalized ad generator that enjoyed a high acceptance rate of 80.56% among surveyed users, demonstrating the power of data-driven approaches in generating engaging and relevant content. Overall, the utilization of data to estimate consumer preferences and style traits is appropriate and effective in enhancing marketing strategies, as evidenced by the success of our deep learning models and personalized ad generator. By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can create targeted and compelling marketing campaigns, thereby increasing their overall success in reaching and resonating with their desired audience."

This study develops a data-driven DSC, including an online manufacturer and an offline retailer with stochastic demand. Then it discusses the effects of the selling price, wholesale price, stock-out-based substitution rate, Data-Driven Marketing (DDM), and two channels’ sensitivity of product quality on the optimal decisions (quality improvement effort, online inventory level, and offline order quantity), and the optimal expected profits. It also analyzes the coordination of the manufacturer's buyback contract. This work is mainly concluded as follows: (1) Increases in DDM quality can increase inventory levels in both channels and efforts to enhance quality, but they can also lower customer return rates, which makes sense. However, it is not always true that DDM quality positively affects the total supply chain expected profit. (2) The decline of one channel's stock-out-based substitution rate can raise its inventory level but decrease the inventory level of the competitive channel. Contrarily, the selling price of one channel is adversely connected with the inventory level of the competitive channel, which extends some existing studies under a decentralized decision. (3) The increase of sensitivity of product quality can lead to the growth of quality improvement efforts (consistent with previous literature) and the reduction of consumer return rate. (4) The manufacturer's buyback contract can well coordinate both members under stochastic demand for Pareto-optimality. Finally, this study proposes some managerial implications and further research directions."

This work extends the data-driven inventory management models with single-source or homogeneous information to those with multisource heterogeneous information. Representation learning and information fusion strategies are used to deal with the challenges of high dimensionality and heterogeneity of multisource heterogeneous information. Quantile regression convolutional attention neural networks with different structures embedding different information fusion strategies are developed to address the problems. Two cases with real-world data are studied, and the results show that the proposed methods using representation learning and/or information fusion strategies have (far) better performances than the existing methods without using these strategies. Moreover, some managerial insights into representation learning and information fusion, different from the practices of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, are provided for inventory management problems."

All rights reserved.Lead propensity prediction is a data-driven method used to define the value of prospects, by assigning points to them based on their engagement with the business's digital channels, based on multiple key attributes correlating to their attraction to the proposed services or items. The resulting score is closely related to the financial worth of each lead and may be revealing its position in the buying cycle. The marketing teams can then focus on generated leads and prioritize the most prominent ones to improve the conversion rates, using the assigned score on the lead scoring step. The authors investigated using a combination of a data-driven approach and Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the lead-scoring process. The experimentation shows that the random forest (RF) is the most suitable model for this task with an accuracy score of 93.04% followed by the decision tree (DT) model of 91.47%. In contrast, when considering the training time, DT and logistic regression (LR) needed a shorter time to learn from the dataset while maintaining decent performances. In contrast, these models represent promising alternatives to the RF model especially in the case of a huge volume of transactions and prospects or in a big data context."

Building on constructivist market studies, we draw attention to the notion of agencing as boundary work and the range of boundary workers in the agencement of which the marketer is part. Drawing on 63 interviews with marketing professionals from multiple contexts, we reveal the difficulties to keep a pace with the plethora of digital marketing tools and highlight the emerging ‘market for digital marketing’ as a key device in the agencing of the digitalised marketer. We present two modes of agencing work, prosthetic and habilitative, to conceptualise how digitalised markets and platforms concurrently enable and captivate marketers’ agency, but also how marketers and their peer networks contest these limits and expand the space for action. This contribution serves to extend the recognised need to reconnect marketing with markets, to also acknowledge how markets are connected to the shaping of marketing and its actors. Implications for theory, practice and marketing education are discussed as we seek to capacitate marketers to operate in an increasingly digitalised environment."

A Reinforcement Learning Approach,Singh V.,Information Systems Frontiers,2023-08-01,10.1007/s10796-022-10314-0,19,Universität Siegen,Article,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.One of the core challenges in digital marketing is that the business conditions continuously change, which impacts the reception of campaigns. A winning campaign strategy can become unfavored over time, while an old strategy can gain new traction. In data driven digital marketing and web analytics, A/B testing is the prevalent method of comparing digital campaigns, choosing the winning ad, and deciding targeting strategy. A/B testing is suitable when testing variations on similar solutions and having one or more metrics that are clear indicators of success or failure. However, when faced with a complex problem or working on future topics, A/B testing fails to deliver and achieving long-term impact from experimentation is demanding and resource intensive. This study proposes a reinforcement learning based model and demonstrates its application to digital marketing campaigns. We argue and validate with actual-world data that reinforcement learning can help overcome some of the critical challenges that A/B testing, and popular Machine Learning methods currently used in digital marketing campaigns face. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique on real actual data for a digital marketing campaign collected from a firm."

They are bracing for a world where third-party tracking will be restricted by design or by law. Digital resignation typically refers to how companies cultivate a sense of powerlessness about privacy among internet users. Our paper looks through this optic from the other end of the lens: How is the digital advertising industry coping with the increasing salience of privacy? Recent developments have forced companies to implement “privacy-preserving” designs—or at least promise some semblance of privacy. Yet, the industry remains dependent on flows of data and means of identification to enable still-desired targeting, measurement, and optimization. Our paper analyzes this contradiction by looking at systems that aim to replicate existing functionalities while protecting user “privacy.” We call this a form of “cynical resignation” and characterize its key maneuvers as follows: (a) sanitizing surveillance; (b) party-hopping; and (c) sabotage. We argue that this “cynical resignation” to a privacy imperative represents a policy failure. In the absence of decisive interventions into the underlying business models of data capitalism, companies offer techno-solutionism and self-regulations that seem to conform to new laws and norms while reinforcing commitments to data-driven personalization. This may benefit the largest tech companies, since their privileged access to first-party data will make more companies reliant on them, and their computational power will be even more valuable in a world where modeling is used to compensate for the loss of third-party data and traditional methods of personal identification."

In the Indian context, as FPCs have emerged as new forms of members-led agribusiness, their ability to identify prevailing social ties and tap them effectively towards business growth needs to be better understood. Although social capital is studied broadly for its potential to drive organizational performance, it has been poorly researched in farmer collectives such as FPCs. The current work examines the effect of social capital on benefits and business performance at the level of member groups in FPCs. An empirical analysis was conducted in which two FPCs, which differed significantly in their mobilization strategies, farming methods, and supply chain linkages, were surveyed. Data collected from the surveys were visualized and clustering analysis was carried out using Self Organizing Maps (SOM), an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) tool. Insights from clustering reveal the importance of pre-existing social ties, leadership, participation in group activities and the geographical affinity of groups in benefits realization and business performance of FPCs. The importance of bottom-up approaches in establishing robust supply chain linkages in emerging FPCs was keyed out through this work. The inferences through SOM, distilled strategies for FPCs' stakeholders in prioritizing interventions for member groups and in generating broader implications for policy makers accounting social capital in new institutional models."

These decisions encompass multiple factors, including a bull’s age, predicted semen production, and estimated genetic merit. This study’s purpose was to provide a practical, objective tool to assist in these decisions. We utilized a Markov Chain model to calculate the economic valuation of dairy bulls, incorporating key factors such as housing costs, collection and marketing expenses, and the bull’s probable tenure in the herd. Data from a leading AI company were used to establish baseline values. The model further compared a bull’s net present value to that of a potential young replacement, establishing a relative valuation (BullVal$). The range of BullVal$ observed spanned from −USD 316,748 to USD 497,710. Interestingly, the model recommended culling for 49% of the bulls based on negative BullVal$. It was found that a bull’s net present value was primarily influenced by market allocation and pricing, coupled with the interaction of semen production and genetic merit. This study offers a robust, data-driven model to guide bull replacement decisions in AI companies. Key determinants of a bull’s valuation included market dynamics, semen production rates, and genetic merit."
85164829959,Cold Start to Improve Market Thickness on Online Advertising Platforms: Data-Driven Algorithms and Field Experiments,Ye Z.,Management Science,2023-07-01,10.1287/mnsc.2022.4550,5,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Article,"© 2022 INFORMS.Cold start describes a commonly recognized challenge for online advertising platforms: with limited data, the machine learning system cannot accurately estimate the click-through rates (CTR) of new ads and, in turn, cannot efficiently price these new ads or match them with platform users. Traditional cold start algorithms often focus on improving the learning rates of CTR for new ads to improve short-term revenue, but unsuccessful cold start can prompt advertisers to leave the platform, decreasing the thickness of the ad marketplace. To address these issues, we build a data-driven optimization model that captures the essential trade-off between short-term revenue and long-term market thickness on the platform. Based on duality theory and bandit algorithms, we develop the shadow bidding with learning (SBL) algorithms with a provable regret upper bound of O(T2=3K1=3 (logT)1=3d1=2), where K is the number of ads and d captures the error magnitude of the underlying machine learning oracle for predicting CTR. Our proposed algorithms can be implemented in a real online advertising system with minimal adjustments. To demonstrate this practicality, we have collaborated with a large-scale video-sharing platform, conducting a novel, two-sided randomized field experiment to examine the effectiveness of our SBL algorithm. Our results show that the algorithm increased the cold start success rate by 61.62% while compromising short-term revenue by only 0.717%. Our algorithm has also boosted the platform’s overall market thickness by 3.13% and its long-term advertising revenue by (at least) 5.35%. Our study bridges the gap between the theory of bandit algorithms and the practice of cold start in online advertising, highlighting the value of well-designed cold start algorithms for online advertising platforms."

An important application of intelligent finance is the precise marketing of financial products. As a key link in precision marketing, click through rate(CTR) prediction has made great progress, but there is still room for improvement in multiple features fusion, feature interactions learning and other aspects. In view of these needs and challenges, we propose a CTR prediction model named MCGM, which is used to realize precision marketing of financial products. The main characteristics of the model are as follows: (i) in order to effectively fuse multiple features, we design a hierarchical gated mechanism to select salient feature information at different levels; (ii) in order to fully learn the nonlinear relationship between features, we design a multi-channel feature interactions learning module. Specifically, it adopts factorization machine(FM), improved CrossNet(ICN) and multilayer perceptron(MLP) components to model the feature interactions from high-order to low-order, in order to obtain the abstract features containing rich information. Comprehensive and sufficient experiments on real world datasets show that the proposed model achieves better prediction performance compared with baselines. The proposed model not only has specific application value in the field of financial products marketing, but also provides an idea reference for data-driven marketing modeling."
85161507113,From the land of Gama: event attachment scale (EAS) development exploring fans' attachment and their intentions to spectate at traditional gaming events,Rehman J.,International Journal of Event and Festival Management,2023-06-27,10.1108/IJEFM-10-2022-0079,0,GIFT University,Article,"© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The desire to spectate at traditional events and festivals in different countries is dying. From a marketing perspective, researchers and practitioners need to understand why people spectate at these conventional events and festivals. Data-driven marketing approaches can help event and festival marketing policymakers in attracting potential spectators. Drawing on attachment theory, the current study fills this void and explores fans' motivation and intentions to follow Kushti (i.e. traditional wrestling) events while developing a new event attachment scale (EAS). Design/methodology/approach: Three comprehensive studies were conducted. First, an exploratory study where 12 retired wrestlers, considered hardcore fans of Kushti were interviewed. The collected data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Second, a pilot study (n = 204) was performed leading to a main survey (n = 365). The survey data was analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. Findings: Results revealed five types of attachments (i.e., ground attachment, game attachment, emotional attachment, cultural attachment and player attachment). An important intervention is the unique elements within each of these attachments, which may motivate fans to follow traditional gaming events. The new scale offers excellent psychometric properties. Practical implications: Event and festival marketers should consider the role of tradition while marketing such events. The retired wrestlers can be used as influences/reference points to attract visitors to spectate at Kushti events. Furthermore, facilities such as smooth roads, approachable grounds and excellent service operations during these events can help policymakers to attract more spectators. Originality/value: The study is unique in contextualizing Kushti and presenting a unique scale to measure fans' motivations and intentions to follow traditional gaming events."

This in-market study focuses on gender differences to investigate different types of visual attention for place-based advertising in a digital marketing context. This study adopts a data-driven scientific approach and demonstrates that gender differences can assess shoppers’ viewing behavior and preference towards different promotional content based on gender schemas. Our results find that gender dynamics are complex. On the one hand, our findings show that female shoppers are more likely to respond to gaze cues and notice place-based advertising if others are also looking at the ad. On the other hand, male shoppers display longer staying and fixation times than females. Although a few detailed results are mixed, in our additional investigation, we found that gender is still a key factor in explaining the initial visual attention to promotional content within place-based advertising."

This study intends to offer a first insight on the adoption of data-driven HR/talent management approach, contributing to the ongoing debate on the Industry 4.0. This study aims to investigate the use of 4.0 technologies in HR and talent management functions, focusing also on the adoption of big data analytics for internal and recruitment communication. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis of the literature enables to define the research questions and an exploratory web survey was carried out through a structured questionnaire. The analysis unit of the empirical survey includes the communication and marketing managers of 90 organizations in Italy, examined in the Mediobanca Report on the “Main Italian Companies.” Findings: Findings highlight a lack of the use of 4.0 technologies and big data analytics in employee and labor market relations and reveal some sectoral differences in the adoption of 4.0 technologies. Moreover, the study points out that the development of HR analytics is hampered by short-term perspective, data quality problems and the lack of analytics skills. Research limitations/implications: Due to the exploratory research design and the circumscribed sample from a single country (Italy), further cross-national evidence is needed. This study provides digital communication managers with useful insights to improve the data-driven HR/talent management approach, which is a strategic asset for ensuring a sustainable competitive advantage and optimizing business performance.

However, its influence on the transformation of core sectors from the perspective of consumer well-being remains under-explored. Seeking to bridge this gap in the marketing and public policy literature, this study aims to propose a conceptual framework to explicate how data-driven, intelligent and connected IR 4.0 technologies are blurring traditional boundaries between digital, physical and biological domains. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper using primarily a literature review of the field. The authors position the work as a contribution to consumer well-being and public policy literature from the lens of increasingly important in our technology-integrated society emerging technologies. Findings: The authors define and conceptualize technology-enabled well-being (TEW), which allows a better understanding of transformative outcomes of IR 4.0 on three essential dimensions of consumer well-being: individual, societal and environmental. Finally, the authors discuss public policy implications and outline future research directions. Originality/value: The authors highlight specific gaps in the literature on IR 4.0. First, past studies in consumer well-being did not incorporate substantial changes that emerging IR 4.0 technologies bring, especially across increasingly blurring digital, physical and biological domains. Second, past research focused on individual technologies and individual well-being. What is unaccounted for is the potential for a synergetic, proactive effect that emerging technologies bring on the aggregate level not only to individuals but also to society and the environment. Finally, understanding the differences between responses to different outcomes of technologies has important implications for developing public policy. Synergetic, proactive effect of technologies on core sectors such as healthcare, education, financial services, manufacturing and retailing is noted."

The main aim of Logistics startups is to increase their digital brand name and user engagement in order to acquire a competitive advantage. To the completion of this target, various digital marketing strategies could be implemented to ensure a differentiating factor. A three-stage data-driven methodology was adopted to evaluate the contribution between the parameters and to reflect strategies that can be presented to improve the website's user engagement and digital brand name. The first part of the study collects data from nine logistics startups’ websites over a period of 180 days. The second part of the study employs Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to develop an exploratory diagnostic model that visually depicts the cause-and-effect relationships between the metrics under consideration. In the last part of the study, a predictive simulation model has been created to present the intercorrelation between the examined metrics and to present possible optimization strategies. According to the findings of this study, Logistics startups’ websites must be developed with fewer web pages and need to be focused on the customers’ target. Additionally, in contradiction with other industries’ websites, logistics startups must maintain a steady flow of digital advertisements to optimize brand name and profit."

This study examines organizational capabilities for data-driven innovation (DDI) in the context of established industrial companies. Building on the prior innovation literature, resource-based view, and dynamic capabilities view, we conduct a qualitative study of technological and marketing capabilities in relation to DDI. Based on interview data from six multinational B2B companies, we find that even though technological capabilities are vital to DDI, five of the six examined companies struggle more with marketing capabilities in developing DDI. The research findings underline the central role of customer understanding and involvement in DDI, as well as the significance of the ability to articulate the DDI value proposition in a form that potential customers can grasp. The study contributes to our understanding of DDI as a phenomenon in the context of established manufacturing companies, and identifies key challenges for intangible data-driven innovations in this context."

85131170892,"Marketing competency, marketing innovation and sustainable competitive advantage of small and medium enterprises (SMEs): a mixed-method analysis",Olazo D.B.,Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics,2023-04-04,10.1108/APJML-01-2022-0050,11,Holy Angel University,Article,"© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of the current research is to investigate the relationship between marketing capabilities and marketing innovation toward the sustainable competitive advantage of small and medium enterprises in the Philippines. The research study aims to improve the prior conducted literature by concentrating on the precursors of innovation in marketing and its impact on building a sustainable competitive market. The paper intends to address this by examining the following variables using a mixed-method approach. Design/methodology/approach: The researcher employed the mixed methods particularly the sequential explanatory design to explain and interpret the quantitative data collected from 89 business owners/managers using Jamovi Software while the qualitative data were collected through an in-depth interview conducted with 10 SME owner-managers of new and established businesses in Angeles City, Pampanga using Taxonomic Coding Scheme. The sequential explanatory design was used to explain and interpret quantitative results by collecting and analyzing follow-up qualitative data. Findings: This study investigates the relationship between marketing capabilities and marketing innovation towards sustainable competitive advantage of micro-small and medium enterprises in the Philippines through mixed method approach. For quantitative result, the study found that marketing competency significantly influenced marketing innovation. The result shows that all SMEs have enough people in place who are capable of implementing marketing innovation activities and use new technology like the use of information technology. The paper also found that marketing innovation, significantly predicted sustainable competitive advantage. MSMEs exhibit this innovation such as product, price, place, and promotion can create a distinctive position in the market towards sustainable competitive advantage. The paper also tested the mediation effect of marketing innovation that influences the relationship between marketing competence and sustainable competitive advantage. Most of the hypotheses posited were supported. For qualitative data, it was revealed that these SMEs through their key informants and key leaders are open to innovations thus, willing to learn by establishing networks with customers and other managers/business owners to expand and improve their business. The food business in Pampanga is highly competitive, and most of the SMEs are engaged with it. In order to survive the saturated market, continuous improvement is important in the identified areas for growth and innovation. Mixed method analysis supported quantitative and qualitative findings. Hence, it indicated that marketing competency significantly influences sustainable competitive advantage, which can be achieved through marketing innovation. In this study, the researcher analyzed the influence between marketing competence and marketing innovation to achieve a sustainable and competitive market. Research limitations/implications: There were certain limitations of this research study. First, the lack of panel data limits the investigation of causality that is instrumental in substantiating the findings. Second, the proposed conceptual framework offers a deeper understanding of innovation performance, examining how integrating activities of the R&D department, human resource department, and marketing department affect innovation commercialization will likely provide more meaningful insights. Moreover, finally, future studies may go beyond the scope of our study to examine (1) food and meat processing, (2) agriculture, hunting, and forestry, (3) hotels and restaurants, (4) mining and quarrying, (5) wholesale and retail trade, (6) transport, storage communication. Practical implications: To remain relevant in this extraordinary time, this paper suggests a support instrument to offer vital data on different categories of innovation to the foodservice sector SMEs in Angeles City to embrace and implement new innovative methods in their practices. The key practical implication of this research, therefore, is the requirement for small and medium business owner-managers to improve their technical capability to realize the full benefits, particularly in terms of more responsive and user-centered, data-driven marketing personnel. Social implications: These findings may influence positive social change by contributing to more effective and efficient marketing practices in small and medium firms that can lead to better financial performance, higher survival rates, and a healthier economic system. This study demonstrates that SME owner-managers require new skillsets to overcome the barriers to adopting technology for marketing.

85141471843,A machine learning-based approach for vital node identification in complex networks,Asgharian Rezaei A.,Expert Systems with Applications,2023-03-15,10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119086,20,RMIT University,Article,"© 2022 Elsevier LtdVital node identification is the problem of finding nodes of highest importance in complex networks. This problem has crucial applications in various contexts such as viral marketing or controlling the propagation of virus or rumours in real-world networks. Existing approaches for vital node identification mainly focus on capturing the importance of a node through a mathematical expression which directly relates structural properties of the node to its vitality. Although these heuristic approaches have achieved good performance in practice, they have weak adaptability, and their performance is limited to specific settings and certain dynamics. Inspired by the power of machine learning models for efficiently capturing different types of patterns and relations, we propose a machine learning-based, data driven approach for vital node identification. The main idea is to train the model with a small portion of the graph, say 0.5% of the nodes, and do the prediction on the rest of the nodes. The ground-truth vitality for the train data is computed by simulating the SIR diffusion method starting from the train nodes. We use collective feature engineering where each node in the network is represented by incorporating elements of its connectivity, degree and extended coreness. Several machine learning models are trained on the node representations, but the best results are achieved by a Support Vector Regression machine with RBF kernel. The empirical results confirms that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on a selection of datasets, while it also shows more adaptability to changes in the dynamics parameters. With respect to correlation of ranking of the nodes with the ground-truth ranking, the proposed model outperforms other models with a margin as high as 4.63%, while it maintains the lowest variation in performance, with a performance difference as low as 5% across different influence probabilities. The proposed model also obtains the highest uniqueness of ranking, achieving almost unique ranking with a monotonicity relation score of more than 0.9997 on four datasets."

Design/methodology/approach: This work establishes a DSC model with DDM, and the offline retailer can provide internal financing to the capital-constrained online manufacturer. The demand under the price is determined based on DDM quality, customer channel preference and delivery lead time. Then, combined with the Stackelberg game, the optimal pricing and delivery-lead-time decisions are discussed under the inconsistent and consistent pricing strategies with decentralized and centralized systems. Furthermore, it designs a manufacturer-revenue sharing contract to coordinate the members under the two pricing strategies. Findings: (1) The increase of DDM quality will reduce the delivery-lead-time under the inconsistent or consistent pricing strategy and will push the selling prices; (2) The growth of the CCR rate will raise selling prices and extend the delivery-lead-time under the decentralized decision; (3) Under price competition, the offline selling price is higher than the online selling price when customers prefer the offline channel and vice versa; (4) The retailer and the manufacturer can achieve a win-win situation through a manufacturer-revenue sharing contract. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the studies related to DSC by investigating pricing and delivery-lead-time decisions based on DDM, CCR, internal financing and supply chain contract and proposes some managerial implications."

In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts. Findings: Drawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a ‘hacking marketing’ approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries. Practical implications: This study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study’s results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm."
85145257650,Basket data-driven approach for omnichannel demand forecasting,Omar H.,International Journal of Production Economics,2023-03-01,10.1016/j.ijpe.2022.108748,5,KEDGE Business School,Article,"© 2022 Elsevier B.V.Omnichannel retailing has changed the purchasing behavior of customers in recent years, especially in online shopping, which has led to higher complexity in supply chain demand forecasting. Nowadays customers buy a variety of products in baskets that do not share similar characteristics and across various channels. In this article, we propose a new approach to forecasting demand, driven by data on customers shopping baskets. Drawing on network graph theory and findings from the marketing literature, we identify for a given product four attributes to promote the connectivity with other products sold together in a basket: degree and strength for cross-categories connection, substitutability and complementarity for within-categories connection. These attributes are used as predictor variables within four proposed methods: an autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogeneous variables (ARIMAX), a linear and a polynomial regression with one lag of sales and a machine learning method. We conduct an empirical investigation using online and physical sales related to an assortment of 24,000 products of a major cosmetics retailer in France. We provide empirical evidence that using the shopping basket data with the proposed forecasting methods improves the forecasting accuracy and the stock control performance in omnichannel retailing. We also show that there is a benefit from joint forecasting of the online and store channels, and a benefit of shared inventory between both channels in terms of shortage reduction."

This reduction may have a significant impact on the computational efforts and storage capacities required to analyze and process high volumes of electricity load curves. Also, the reduction to 2 or even 1 component enables its graphic representation. Specifically, this work is mainly focused on profiles defined by their monthly demand values, and where the clients are aggregated by locations and/or economic activities. This approach is of great interest for marketing analysis and decision-making of electricity retailers. In this sense, the use of dimensionality reduction techniques based on knowledge (calendar and temperature) along with the application of data-driven procedures (Principal Component Analysis and autoencoders), are explored in the paper. The results of this research show that autoencoders clearly outperform the other techniques, yielding errors in the reduction process between 15% to 40% lower and preserving distances between profiles in the low-dimensional spaces, with a correlation of 0.93 with the distances in high dimensional space. Additionally, the bidimensional graphical representation of a profile can easily be interpreted in a polar way, where the angle denotes the shape of the profile, and the radius reveals its scale. To reach these results, a very large dataset has been employed, with about half a million aggregated profiles corresponding to the electricity consumption during 3 years of more than 27 million clients in Spain."

85148696340,Green Agricultural Products Supply Chain Subsidy Scheme with Green Traceability and Data-Driven Marketing of the Platform,Wang X.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2023-02-01,10.3390/ijerph20043056,3,Qingdao University,Article,"© 2023 by the authors.Government subsidies have played an important role in the development of green agriculture. In addition, the Internet platform is becoming a new channel to realize green traceability and promote the sale of agricultural products. In this context, we consider a two-level green agricultural products supply chain (GAPSC) consisting of one supplier and one Internet platform. The supplier makes green R&D investments to produce green agricultural products along with conventional agricultural products, and the platform implements green traceability and data-driven marketing. The differential game models are established under four government subsidy scenarios: no subsidy (NS), consumer subsidy (CS), supplier subsidy (SS), and supplier subsidy with green traceability cost-sharing (TSS). Then, the optimal feedback strategies under each subsidy scenario are derived using Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming theory. The comparative static analyses of key parameters are given, and the comparisons among different subsidy scenarios are conducted. Numerical examples are employed to obtain more management insights. The results show that the CS strategy is effective only if the competition intensity between two types of products is below a certain threshold. Compared to the NS scenario, the SS strategy can always improve the supplier’s green R&D level, the greenness level, market demand for green agricultural products, and the system’s utility. The TSS strategy can build on the SS strategy to further enhance the green traceability level of the platform and the greenness level and demand for green agricultural products due to the advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism. Accordingly, a win-win situation for both parties can be realized under the TSS strategy. However, the positive effect of the cost-sharing mechanism will be weakened as the supplier subsidy increases. Moreover, compared to three other scenarios, the increase in the environmental concern of the platform has a more significant negative impact on the TSS strategy."

Market segmentation gives industries the potential to classify similar customers and categorize their preferred target markets to ensure marketing expenses' operative management. It has been a practical approach for business improvement in tourism and hospitality. Big data are fundamentally changing the management of the hospitality sector and the relationship between the customer and business by simplifying the decision-making process based on large amounts of data. The data provided in social media have played an important role in customer segmentation. In fact, the data provided by the customers in social media have been a valuable source for decision-makers to precisely discover the customers' satisfaction dimensions on their services. Therefore, there is a need for the development of data-driven approaches for social data analysis for customers segmentation. This research aims to develop a new data-driven approach to reveal customers' satisfaction in restaurants. Specifically, k-means and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with the aid of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique are, respectively, used in data clustering and prediction tasks. In this research, the data of customers on the service quality of restaurants are collected from the TripAdvisor platform. The results of the data analysis are provided. We evaluate the prediction model through a set of evaluation metrics, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), compared with the other prediction approaches. The results showed that k-means-PSO-ANN (MSE = 0.09847; R2 = 0.98764) has outperformed other methods. The current study demonstrates that the use of online review data for customer segmentation can be an effective way in the restaurant industry in relation to the traditional data analysis approaches."

While numerous studies highlight increasing demand for diversity among some consumers, such enthusiasm is not universal. This is creating challenges for brands, some of which have faced backlash, either due to a perceived lack of authenticity in their diversity efforts or because not all consumer groups value diversity equally. Amidst these challenges, technological advancements, such as data-driven decision-making and generative AI, present both new opportunities and risks. The current literature on diverse representation in advertising, although expansive, is relatively siloed. Through a detailed eight-step process, we assess and synthesize the body of literature on diversity representation, reviewing 337 articles spanning research on age, beauty, body size, gender, LGBTQIA+ , physical and mental ability, and race and ethnicity. Our investigation offers two major contributions: a summarization of insights from the broader literature on these seven key areas of diverse representation and development of an integrated conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework details mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes that are either prevalent across the literature or can be reasonably expected to generalize across other forms of diversity. This framework not only offers a holistic perspective for academics and industry professionals but also exposes potential future research avenues."

G. V. Bramley et al.Background and Aims. Previous work in Australia has demonstrated the value of data-driven approaches to terroir analysis but, like other terroir research, focussed predominantly on the natural resources (soils, topography, and climate) on which winegrowing depends. In only very few cases have metrics of production performance also been considered. In this study, focussed on the Marlborough region of New Zealand, we integrated data pertaining to vineyard performance with biophysical data (soils and climate) describing the conditions under which grapes are grown to give a more holistic indication of regional-scale variation in the terroir of the Marlborough production system. Methods and Results. Digital map layers describing variation in climate, soil properties, and the yield and harvest date of Sauvignon Blanc (Vitis vinifera L.) were assembled and analysed for similarity in their patterns of spatial variation over six vintages (2014–2019) using k-means clustering. Te results suggest that the Marlborough region has a characteristically variable Sauvignon Blanc production with crop phenology and harvest date strongly infuenced by variation in temperature, and yield variation impacted by soil properties. Spatial variation in seasonal rainfall did not appear to impact on vineyard performance. Importantly, the Wairau and Awatere valleys which, hitherto, have been considered together as parts of a single Marlborough region, are shown to be distinct. Conclusions. Tis analysis is strongly suggestive of the Marlborough terroir being variable at the within-region scale. It also lends weight to the idea that estimates of vineyard performance in some parts of the region may be used to predict performance in others. Signifcance of the Study. Te results have potentially important implications for the management of both vineyard operations and winery logistics, for wine marketing and for whole-of-industry planning around expansion or contraction. Te methods used are free of any bias introduced to many previous studies of terroir zoning through adherence to historical or geopolitical boundaries, expert opinion of wines, and other heuristics."

To find performance indicators of data quality to maximize the effectiveness of CRM, we need to devise an approach to identifying and managing 'business-relevant' information quality metrics. Therefore, this paper deals with the discovery and validation of the Data Quality Dimension (DQD) in terms of meaning and utilization value of data values other than the aspects such as syntax criteria or data format. We design the quality index and scoring logic of the customer integration profile and prove its usefulness by applying it to actual CRM data. A sample of real business operations data of approximately 1 million CRM customers was used to analyze the relevance between the DQDs and business performance indicators. As business performance indicators, we used both the company's purchasing loyalty index and the performance of past promotional campaigns. We analyzed the significant impact of each DQD on purchase loyalty and promotional campaign success rate. Next, we confirmed the effectiveness of DQDs in terms of providing analytic ease for predictive analysis such as target marketing in CRM. In addition, we showed some possibilities to consider improving data quality by analyzing the granularity of a specific attribute based on a certain DQD. Through these verification results, the validity of the DQDs of the customer profile was confirmed in the context of 'suitability for use' of customer data that affects business activities critical to the company in the CRM system."

Meaning, nobody looks beyond the first page of search results. In a cookie-free future, search engines double down on how marketers communicate expertise, authority, and trust. This pushes brands to shift away from product-focused search engine marketing, toward an intent-based approach. To stay at the top of search engine results, marketers must understand consumer assessment of search results. Guided by an integrated framework combining UTAUT2, theory of reasoned action, and media richness theory, this empirical study used a 2 (search result type: organic vs. sponsored) × 3 (presentation format: text-only vs. image vs. video) between-subjects research design for assessing the effects of search results on consumer decisions. Results help establish the connection between consumer perceptions of search results and purchase decisions. Implications for AI-driven search engine marketing are presented."

When businesses encounter risky situations (calculated risks) complex models using BDA are often the go-to solution. However, there is a still a debate if BDA is the best solution in uncertain situations when unexpected phenomena arise. The present study begins to fill this gap using the Colombian context as evidence and a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fs-QCA). The focus shifts from a single cause leading to performance to an analysis of different associations of conditions. There are three major findings-first, in a risky environment, BDA is not a unique condition; a combination of data maturity levels, data skills and a data-driven mindset and culture are necessary to obtain good business performance. Second, even in the era of Big Data, large companies still use simple rules (heuristics) to make decisions which improve their performance. Finally, the environmental state (uncertain, certain, risky) is a moderating factor in the choice between BDA or Heuristics. The results indicate marketing managers should use a multi-model approach incorporating both BDA and heuristics."
85159344818,Shooting for the stars: What are the topics of reviews that affect star ratings?,Ahmad S.N.,Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences,2023-01-01,10.1002/cjas.1719,1,Morgan State University,Article,"© 2023 ASAC.There is evidence that review ratings affect sales; yet little is known about the drivers of the star ratings from the perspective of the customers who have written them. A person who writes a review touches upon many different aspects of the experience. It is intriguing to explore the underlying topics that motivate customers to provide certain star ratings. Although there have been many studies to predict rating, they are mostly data driven. A marketing perspective and a consumer theory driven approach is still in their infancy. This article aims to fill this gap in the literature, and to explore the topics of reviews and their effects in determining the star ratings of a review. Since review rating influences prospective customers, traffic to the site and ultimately sales, examining the topics that make a customer rate a review in a certain manner is theoretically and managerially important."

The objective of this article is to examine the effects of age and gender on live streaming commerce platform usage and investigate user characteristics of these platforms in China. This study adopted a data-driven persona construction method combining quantitative and qualitative methods through the use of survey and interview. The survey involved 506 participants (age range = 19–70), and the interview involved 12 participants. The survey findings showed that age significantly affected users’ livestream platform usage, while gender did not. Younger users had higher device proficiency and operation numbers. With more trust and device use, older users used the platforms later in the day than younger users. Interview findings revealed that gender affected users’ motivations and value focus. Women tended to use the platforms as a means of entertainment. Women valued service quality and enjoyment more, while men focused on the accuracy of product information more. Four personas with significant differences were then constructed: Dedicated, Dependent, Active and Lurker. Their various needs, motivations and behavior patterns can be considered by designers to elevate the interaction of live streaming commerce platforms."

However, they face the challenge of crossing the knowledge divide between analytics groups and business groups. Exploring relationships between the two groups in 37 data-driven organizational initiatives, we develop a configuration-based model that explains analytics and business-domain knowledge integration through the lens of synergy. Our configurational analyses revealed five configurations of relationships between the two, which bring about two distinct change outcomes: “dedicated data groups” and “multidisciplinary teams” lead to the emergence of new data-driven ways to work, and “analytics institutionalization,” “analytics resource optimization,” and “networked communities” produce convergence, through the sharing of data-driven ways to work. Each configuration displays a distinct element of the core processes identified (“developing group connectedness,” “exchanging analytics and business domain knowledge,” and “incentivizing organizational data use”) and yields either an emergence or convergence of data-driven ways of working. The findings demonstrate how data-driven organizational initiatives can benefit from a pervasive form of organizing that entwines analytics groups and business groups such that their members’ tools, mindsets, and behaviors are merged to profoundly change ways of working. Together, these findings and the configurational methodology used provide a nuanced picture of how organizations integrate the requisite specialist knowledge across domains to realize value from data."

One area where social media advertising is just gaining a foothold is in the recruitment of clinical study participants. Here, as everywhere, social media advertising promises more yield per money spent because the technology can better reach highly specialised groups. In this article, we point out severe societal risks posed by advertising for clinical studies on social media. We show that social media advertising for clinical studies in many cases violates the privacy of individual users (R1), creates collective privacy risks by helping platform companies train predictive models of medical information that can be applied to all their users (R2), exploits the weaknesses of existing guidelines in (biomedical) research ethics (R3) and is detrimental to the quality of (biomedical) research (R4). We argue that the well-intentioned promises, which are often associated with the use of social media advertising for clinical studies, are untenable from a balanced point of view. Consequently, we call for updates of research ethics guidelines and better regulation of Big Data and inferential analytics. We conclude that social media advertising – especially with vulnerable patient populations – is not suitable as a recruitment tool for clinical studies as long as the processing of (even anonymised) social media usage data and the training of predictive models by data analytics and artificial intelligence companies is not sufficiently regulated."

However, digital marketing strategies and business models can succeed only if content marketing is developed correctly. This study aims to develop a relevant theoretical framework linked to content marketing and identify the leading techniques and uses linked to its development. In this context, we developed an innovative data-driven methodology consisting of three steps. In the first phase, sentiment analysis that works with machine learning was conducted with Textblob, and four experiments were performed using support vector classifier, multinomial naïve bayes, logistic regression, and random forest classifier. First, we aimed to increase the accuracy of sentiment analysis (negative, neutral and positive) of a sample of user-generated content collected from the social network Twitter. Second, a mathematical topic-modelling algorithm known as latent dirichlet allocation was used to divide the database into topics. Finally, a textual analysis was developed using the Python programming language. Based on the results, we identified 11 topics, of which four were positive (Smart Content, Video Marketing, Podcast, and Influencer Marketing). Six of them were neutral (Content Personalization, Social Media Posts, Blogging, search engine optimization, Advergames, and NFTs), and one was negative (Email Marketing). Our results suggest that companies should use content personalisation ethically, mainly when AI-based techniques are used to predict user behaviors. While content marketing strategies are a fundamental part of digital marketing tactics, they can elicit changes in user online behavior when Big Data or AI algorithms are used. This fact raises concerns about the non-ethical design of online strategies in digital environments and the imperative that content marketing strategies should not be developed with purely economic and profitability interests."
85148294493,Hamiltonian sequential Monte Carlo with application to consumer choice behavior,Burda M.,Econometric Reviews,2023-01-01,10.1080/07474938.2022.2140982,0,University of Toronto,Article,"© 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The practical use of nonparametric Bayesian methods requires the availability of efficient algorithms for posterior inference. The inherently serial nature of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods imposes limitations on their efficiency and scalability. In recent years, there has been a surge of research activity devoted to developing alternative implementation methods that target parallel computing environments. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), also known as a particle filter, has been gaining popularity due to its desirable properties. SMC uses a genetic mutation-selection sampling approach with a set of particles representing the posterior distribution of a stochastic process. We propose to enhance the performance of SMC by utilizing Hamiltonian transition dynamics in the particle transition phase, in place of random walk used in the previous literature. We call the resulting procedure Hamiltonian Sequential Monte Carlo (HSMC). Hamiltonian transition dynamics have been shown to yield superior mixing and convergence properties relative to random walk transition dynamics in the context of MCMC procedures. The rationale behind HSMC is to translate such gains to the SMC environment. HSMC will facilitate practical estimation of models with complicated latent structures, such as nonparametric individual unobserved heterogeneity, that are otherwise difficult to implement. We demonstrate the behavior of HSMC in a challenging simulation study and contrast its favorable performance with SMC and other alternative approaches. We then apply HSMC to a panel discrete choice model with nonparametric consumer heterogeneity, allowing for multiple modes, asymmetries, and data-driven clustering, providing insights for consumer segmentation, individual level marketing, and price micromanagement."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.We apply causal machine learning algorithms to assess the causal effect of a marketing intervention, namely a coupon campaign, on the sales of a retailer. Besides assessing the average impacts of different types of coupons, we also investigate the heterogeneity of causal effects across different subgroups of customers, e.g., between clients with relatively high vs. low prior purchases. Finally, we use optimal policy learning to determine (in a data-driven way) which customer groups should be targeted by the coupon campaign in order to maximize the marketing intervention's effectiveness in terms of sales. We find that only two out of the five coupon categories examined, namely coupons applicable to the product categories of drugstore items and other food, have a statistically significant positive effect on retailer sales. The assessment of group average treatment effects reveals substantial differences in the impact of coupon provision across customer groups, particularly across customer groups as defined by prior purchases at the store, with drugstore coupons being particularly effective among customers with high prior purchases and other food coupons among customers with low prior purchases. Our study provides a use case for the application of causal machine learning in business analytics to evaluate the causal impact of specific firm policies (like marketing campaigns) for decision support."

Within technology usage, the adoption of disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been the most discussed in the FinTech space. However, the entire discussion has been either from the perspective of the use of data-driven driven algorithms, the benefits of AI, or the effect of AI on the labor market. Very few studies have focussed on examining how implementing disruptive technologies such as AI can affect FinTech start-ups’ internal organizational resources and external natural resources including minerals and the allied industries. The present study addresses this gap by collecting qualitative data from 25 employees of FinTech start-ups in the United Kingdom to understand their impact on resources, particularly the natural ones including minerals. The collected data was analyzed to uncover how the implementation of disruptive digital technologies such as AI in day-to-day operations and digital marketing of FinTech start-ups impacted the internal organizational resources, including employees. The study also sought to uncover the impact of the same on the external resources – customers, and the environment including mineral resources and the allied industry. The study's findings provide valuable insights into how FinTech start-ups can gain from AI implementation in their operations, digital marketing, and resource use optimization."

All Rights Reserved.A newsboy problem is a typical stochastic inventory management problem and has extensive applications in the fields of operational research, management sciences and marketing sciences. One of the challenges underlying such problems is to handle the uncertainty of demands. In the existing results, it is often to assume that the demand distribution is given to facilitate solution of the problems. In this paper, a novel data-driven robust optimization model for solving multi-item newsboy problems is proposed by combining the absolute robust optimization with a data-driven uncertainty set, and the latter is leveraged to address the uncertainty of demands. For the single-item situation, a closed-form solution is obtained and influences of parameters on the optimal solutions are analyzed. Owing to complexity of the multi-item situation, a uniform smoothing function is leveraged to smooth the proposed model. Then, an algorithm, called a modified Frank-Wolfe feasible direction algorithm, is developed to solve a series of smooth subproblems. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the proposed model in this paper can reduce over-conservation of robust optimization methods and is more robust than other similar well-established methods in the literature. By numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that: (1) The proposed method can provide more stable optimal order policy and profits than the existing ones; (2) For a product with a higher unit purchase price, the optimal order quantities are more sensitive to its change; (3) In view of profitability, the newsboy should not to be too risk-averse."

All Rights Reserved.Introduction – Current study examines the relationship between Digital Advertising (DA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their impact on creating a suitable Marketing Strategy (MS) for any organization. The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation."

All rights reserved.Whereas the need for integrated marketing communication has been given considerable attention by researchers in recent decades, the integration of creativity into integrated marketing communication has not. Differences between how creativity is valued in advertising versus specialized digital marketing agencies within an integrated marketing communication environment may lead to brand message diffusion. The current study addresses these differences and investigates what defines, drives, and inspires creative collaboration and how it relates to the motivational theory of creativity. Drawing on a social-constructivist methodology, the authors generated empirical data from leaders of industry-acclaimed agencies from four European countries (Norway, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom). On the basis of that data, the authors propose a conceptual model which managers can use as a roadmap for improving the creative integrated marketing communication process, while opening the door to future research possibilities."

It is essential for managers to gain a confident understanding of their business environments in order to make successful decisions. With the growth of opinion-rich web resources such as social media, discussion forums, review sites, news corpora, and blogs available on the internet, product and service reviews have become an essential source of information. In a data-driven world, they will improve services and operational insights to achieve real business benefits and help enterprises remain competitive. Despite the prevalence of textual data, few studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of real-time text mining and reporting tools in firms and organizations. To address this aspect of decision-making, we have developed and evaluated an unsupervised learning system to automatically extract and classify topics and their emotion score in text streams. Data were collected from commercial websites, open-access databases, and social networks to train the model. In the experiment, the polarity score was quantified at four different levels: word, sentence, paragraph, and the entire text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using subjective data mining, we demonstrate how to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of information from the Web and help traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to capture more information. An opinion tracking system presented by our model extracts subjective information, classifies them, and tracks opinions by utilizing location, time, and reviewers’ positions. Using the online-offline data collection technique, we can update the library topic in real-time to provide users with a market opinion tracker. For marketing or economic research, this approach may be useful. In the experiment, the new model is applied to a case study to demonstrate how the business process improves."

Systemic gaps in overdose data limit the opportunity for data-driven prevention efforts and resource allocation. This study aims to improve overdose surveillance and community response through developing a digital platform for overdose reporting and response among harm reduction organizations. We used a community-engaged, user-center design research approach. We conducted qualitative interviews with N = 44 overdose stakeholders including people who use drugs and harm reductionists. Results highlighted the need for a unified, multilingual reporting system uniquely tailored for harm reduction organizations. Anonymity, data transparency, protection from legal repercussions, data accuracy, and community-branded marketing emerged as key themes for the overdose platform. Emergent themes included the need for real-time data in a dashboard designed for community response and tailored to first responders and harm reduction organizations. This formative study provides the groundwork for improving overdose surveillance and data-driven response through the development of an innovative overdose digital platform."

The main challenge with customer profitability prediction is asymmetry, i.e., skewness of the distribution, because the number of highly profitable customers is very small compared to others. Although data mining methods are more resistant to sample heterogeneity than statistical ones, due to strong skewness, the accuracy of predictions often decreases as the value of profit increases. These few customers are actually outliers which can make data-driven methods to overestimate predicted amounts, but on the other hand, they contain very important information about the most valuable customers, so it is not advisable to remove them. In this paper, a data mining approach for overcoming these problems is proposed. The results show that the relative error in predicting the absolute amount of the profitability of the most valuable customers is very small and does not differ much from the error for other customers, unlike previously applied methods where predicting high profitability was less accurate. Accordingly, the specific implication of the high accuracy is more efficient identification of the most profitable customers, which ultimately make a greater contribution to the company in terms of revenue. Also, due to the good precision of the model, errors in the assessment of highly profitable and risky customers are reduced, which leads to savings in unnecessary costs for the marketers."

This study aims to examine the role of social media and goal-directed behavior in motivating healthy lifestyle intentions for customers experiencing obesity. It investigates the distinct roles of self-conscious emotions (shame and pride) and weight-transformational posts shared by others on social media as moderators of these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model uses the goal-directed behavior theory and social comparison theory, tested using data collected from 804 obese customers in Fiji through an experimental design. Findings: Weight-loss transformation posts by others on social media, elicit distinct emotions for obese customers. Obese customers who felt guilt and shame due to shared weight-loss transformation posts showed a stronger association between goal disclosure and healthy lifestyle intention. In addition, the association between goal disclosure and healthy lifestyle intention is conditionally mediated by goal commitment, specifically for those obese customers that elicited guilt over shame due to shared weight-loss transformation posts by others on social media. Research limitations/implications: Despite the adoption of an experimental design using a fictional stimulus being a commonly used method in marketing studies, external validity issues are likely. Also, this study examines obese customer behavior relating to Facebook. In addition, data collection for this study has been done from a single country perspective. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised when generalizing the findings of this study. Practical implications: The findings assist businesses and marketers in the health and fitness industry to better leverage social media and goal-directed behavior and understand the emotions of obese customers to undertake data-driven precision marketing strategies. Originality/value: The findings provide novel insights into goal disclosure and commitment, electronic word-of-mouth on social media platforms, self-conscious emotions and healthy lifestyle intentions for customers experiencing obesity."

All rights reserved.Background: One of the key features of digital marketing is customer centricity, which can be applied to the domain of health. This is expressed through the ability to target specific customer segments with relevant content using appropriate channels and having data to track and understand each interaction. In order to do this, marketers create buyer personas based on a wide spectrum of quantitative and qualitative data. Digital ethnography is another established method for studying web-based communities. However, for practitioners, the complexity, rigor, and time associated with ethnographical work are sometimes out of reach. Objective: This paper responds to the gaps in the practically focused method of using social media for digital ethnography to develop buyer personas. This paper aims to demonstrate how digital ethnography can be used as a way to create and refine buyer personas. Methods: Using a case study of the Fan Fit smartphone app, which aimed to increase physical activity, a digital ethnography was applied to create a better understanding of customers and to create and refine buyer personas. Results: We propose two buyer personas, and we develop a 6-step digital ethnography framework designed for the development of buyer personas. Conclusions: The key contribution of this work is the proposal of a 6-step digital ethnography framework designed for the development of buyer personas. We highlight that the 6-step digital ethnography could be a robust tool for practitioners and academicians to analyze digital communications for the process of creating and updating data-driven buyer personas to create deeper insights into digital and health marketing efforts."

This study develops a machine learning model to estimate the number of departing foreign visitors from Türkiye by reasons for the next 10 years to gain a deeper understanding of their future behaviors. The data between 2003 and 2021 are extensively analyzed, and a multi-dimensional model having a higher-order fractional-order polynomial structure is constructed. The resulting model can predict the 10 reasons of departing foreign visitors for the next 10 years and can update the predictions every year as new data becomes available as it has stable polynomial parameters. In addition, a batch-type genetic algorithm is modified to learn the unknown model parameters by considering the disruptions, such as the coup attempt in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2019, termed as uncertainties. Thus, the model can estimate the overall behavior of the departing foreign visitors in the presence of uncertainties, which is the dominant character of the foreign visitors by their reasons. Furthermore, the developed model is utterly data-driven, meaning it can be trained with the data collected from different cities, regions, and countries. It is predicted that the departing foreign visitors for all reasons will increase at various rates between 2022 and 2031, while the increase in transit visitors is predicted to be higher than the others. The results are discussed, and suggestions are given considering the marketing science. This study can be helpful for global and local firms in tourism, governmental agencies, and civil society organizations."

Poddar Institute of Management and Technology,Article,"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.This paper proposes value addition to the classical Influence Maximization problem by introducing a quality measure to the participating nodes. The quality measure signifies the ‘propensity to buy’ of a customer (node) in a promotional marketing campaign context. Two metrics, Individual Net Worth (INW) and Neighborhood Net Worth (NNW) are proposed to measure the potential of a customer(s) in buying a given product. The proposed solution, through a heuristic approach, is capable of spreading the influence to the customers with a higher propensity to buy the product. The solution is scalable and adaptable to address user requirements. All these claims are substantiated through experimental results on public datasets. We performed a comparative study with notable algorithms in this domain. The result shows that the proposed approach selects seeds of higher quality as well as maximizes the overall quality (worth) of the influenced nodes in comparison to the notable algorithms, without any adverse impact on time complexity."

Consequently, we study how personalized product recommendations (recommendation agents) and price promotions (algorithmic pricing) compensate for the negative impact that consumer's perceived cognitive effort causes on loyalty. By default, the relationship from perceived cognitive efforts to attitudinal and behavioral loyalty is negative, yet these results demonstrate that personalized price promotions lessen the negative impact, while personalized product recommendations do not have such an influence. The findings contribute to a better understanding of personalized marketing activities in today's data-driven online grocery retailing."

In response, some consumers deliberately falsify information in order to redress the balance of power, a practice that constitutes a serious threat to the digital economy. The topic of falsification is still largely under-researched in information systems and marketing. Based on protection motivation theory, the author conceptualizes privacy controls as a source of information and the falsification of information as a coping response, with vulnerability representing the threat appraisal mechanism and self-efficacy the coping appraisal mechanism. Through a within-subject experiment (n = 207), the results of the mediation analysis for repeated measures show that the effect of privacy controls as a source of information on the falsification of information is fully mediated by vulnerability and self-efficacy. The author provides insights for managers regarding the significant trade-off between reducing consumer vulnerability and maintaining the usefulness of the data."
85135008520,A Test for Product Design Features Perceived as Sustainable to Drive Online Purchasing Decisions,El Dehaibi N.,Journal of Mechanical Design,2022-11-01,10.1115/1.4054873,0,Stanford Engineering,Article,"© 2022 by ASME.Designers are challenged to create sustainable products that succeed in the marketplace, often relying on life cycle analyses to identify engineered sustainable features while neglecting perceived-as-sustainable (PAS) features. PAS features may not contribute to engineered sustainability but are identified by customers as sustainable. In previous papers, we proposed methods for extracting PAS features from online reviews using machine learning techniques and validating them using collage placement techniques. We demonstrated our methods using French presses (and other products). In this paper, we combined design and marketing approaches to test previously extracted PAS features in terms of purchasing products that include PAS features, as compared to others that do not. We built a simulated Amazon shopping experience using incentive alignment and constructed a within-subject, fractional factorial design with a variety of product features and physical appearances. We collected data on purchase intent, willingness to pay, and sustainability rating. We found that participants opted to purchase products with PAS features more often than products with features that are not PAS, termed ""dummy""features. Participants also indicated they were willing to pay more for products with PAS features and rated those products as more sustainable, despite the features not contributing to engineered sustainability. Our findings demonstrate the potential value of identifying and including PAS features in sustainable products and a new application for shopping simulation experiments in design research. We recommend that sustainable designers include both engineered and PAS features in sustainable products to align with customer needs, drive purchasing decisions, and potentially increase profitability."

Key factors driving positive/negative learning experiences in business MOOCs were identified and explored. A topic modelling algorithm—Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—was used to examine 144,946 online reviews of 729 business courses on Coursera between August 7, 2015 and August 16, 2021. Two major themes and 11 topics emerged as MOOC delivery (professor, information, comprehension, assessment and materials) and subject matter (finance, marketing, people management, computer skills, technology and project management). A textual salience-valence analysis was employed to analyze the factors driving positive/negative learning experiences regarding MOOC delivery. Findings suggested that 1) business MOOCs should value the importance of instructors' professional and celebrity image to appeal to learners, 2) course design and structure should be easy and simple to manage by learners, 3) course contents, information and assessment should be challenging rather than hard, and 4) the application and validation of peer reviews in both learning process and assessment should be more responsive to eliminate potential issues that could negatively impact learning experiences."

The VAERS database contains de-identified patient-reported adverse events following vaccination and represents post-marketing surveillance and analysis of vaccine safety. After adjusting for time at risk, this resulted in estimated incidence rates of 3.19 seizures per 100 000 persons per year for the COVID-19 vaccine and 0.090 seizures per 100 000 persons per year for the influenza vaccines. A data-driven, individualized dataset that is comprehensive and coupled with a longitudinal follow-up in larger numbers of vaccinated individuals is needed to expand on our preliminary findings of vaccine-related seizures."

Over the past decade, steady progress has been made towards the development of advanced battery diagnostic and prognostic technologies using data-driven methods that can be used to inform EV owners of the condition of their battery over its lifetime. The research has shown promise for accurately predicting battery state of health (SOH), state of safety (SOS), cycle life, the remaining useful life (RUL), and indicators of cells with high risk of failure (i.e., weak cells). These methods yield information about the battery that would be of great interest to EV owners, but at present it is not shared with them. This paper is concerned with the present status of the information available on the battery with a focus on data-driven diagnostic and prognostic approaches, and how the information would be generated in the future for the millions of EVs that will be on the road in the next decade. Finally, future trends and key challenges for the prognostics and health management of the batteries in real-world EV applications are presented from four perspectives (cloud-edge interaction, full-scale diagnosis, artificial intelligence and electronic health reports) are discussed."

For companies, this has become a business opportunity. Data usage on platforms requires that platform companies co-create services for common customers. In this case, the target is not to make the same value proposition but rather to use the resources such as data, knowledge, technology, or institutions in a complementary manner. Platforms are characterized as a combination of hardware and software including standards, interfaces, and rules making it possible for different ecosystem players to complement and interact in the ecosystem. Current ecosystems include several platforms that do not work without resource integration. The purpose of this study is to increase understanding what do we mean by resource complementarity in service ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: This study was done via an in-depth qualitative case study in which a health service ecosystem co-creating technological surgery innovation was used as a unit of analysis. Findings: The authors’ findings suggest that key resource capabilities, to enable complementarity in service ecosystems, are motivation, knowledge, skills, data and complementary designed technology components. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ study increases theoretical understanding of what does one mean by construct of resource complementarity. Practical implications: From a managerial perspective, it is shown that organizations need to develop adaptive capabilities to utilize internal and external competencies and resources and enable co-creative processes within the service ecosystem. Originality/value: Very few empirical studies in the marketing literature have focused on multi-sided digital platforms and their resource complementarity in the data-driven healthcare ecosystem settings."

By 2017, stage 1 of the RBI has been completed, and research is needed to find out the level of usage, proficiency, and productivity achieved by then. Therefore, a survey was carried out to learn whether the rural residents and their communities are making good use of the new fast broadband connection. The survey collected data from 217 rural residents from North Island, and the results indicate that about half of the interview respondents are satisfied with the new broadband speed and the reliability which is offered by RBI stage 1. However, there is about 28% of the respondents disagreed with them. The majority of the Internet uses for rural residents are information searching, reading news, online entertainment, and online banking. Besides that, only a small proportion of respondents know how to utilize the Internet in their work/business and benefit/profit from it, e.g., using cloud technology capabilities and online marketing campaigns, etc. by then. Therefore, we argue that information and communications technologies (ICT) adoption is not only the availability of the infrastructure but also the beneficial outcomes of Internet availability. In other words, Internet skills in-depth training and education need to catch up with the infrastructure deployment, which is useful to fuel the digital productivity and inclusion for booming rural economies. The survey data-driven findings presented in this paper could serve as a reference to inform government policymakers and those who wish to create, invest, and take actions to speed up the economic and social growth of rural communities in Aotearoa New Zealand through the Internet while shifting from the Internet speed and traffic volume-driven to a more effective Internet connectivity and value-added driven rural economy."

However, influencer identification is understudied, and most previous studies have only discussed visible characteristics of influencers and their social networks, overlooking content-based metrics. Combining interdisciplinary theories and techniques from marketing, linguistics, and computer science, we propose a data-driven automated text analysis framework to identify characteristics of effective influencers using influencer posts. Specifically, we propose a model that incorporates influencer personality traits captured by natural language processing, accounting for traditional covariates, such as network structure and follower engagement. In addition, we use a dataset that attributes influencer social media activities to customer purchases to address fake engagement and showcase our automated textual analysis. The proposed framework can help marketers develop influencer profiles and predict optimal influencers for their campaigns."

Simple segmentation tools that are easy to administer and simple for audience members to complete may increase the use of segmentation across the social marketing process. Focus of the Article: Segmentation is a foundational marketing principle which allows marketers to tailor marketing activity to the needs of specific groups (segments). Evidence shows that behaviour change is more likely when more principles are used, yet segmentation remains underutilised. Data-driven methods are used to identify segments based on several variables collected via surveys, but they take time, require large sample sizes and technical analyses; and can be costly and time consuming. Importance to the Field: Simple diagnostic tools are needed to simplify data collection and increase the use of key social marketing principles such as segmentation. Methods: Three studies were conducted to create and verify a short diagnostic segmentation tool and later refine a tool that reflects contemporary social marketing practice. The first employed multiple linear regression to predict segment membership based on previously performed two-step cluster analysis. The second applied the tool to another data set to verify whether the tool could predict segment membership accurately. The final study delivers a short diagnostic tool following the same development approach to a data set drawn from a larger sample that included objective measures ensuring focus moved beyond how individuals think and feel. Results: Segments in the first study had been defined by five variables (derived from 16 survey questions). The tool was able to predict segment membership to a high level of accuracy from five questions. In the second study the tool was used to predict segments, which had high correspondence to the segments identified in that analysis, which was also based on five variables (16 questions). The third study extended development to an analysis using 16 defining variables, based on 40 survey questions. The final tool predicted segment membership to a high degree of accuracy based on five survey questions. Recommendations for Research or Practice: Segmentation is important for developing understanding that enables social marketers to design social change programs to meet the needs of more people. This simple tool developed and verified within and across samples has potential to simplify data collection enabling greater uptake of segmentation in social marketing practice. The final tool incorporated objective measures to ensure segmentation moves beyond the myopic consumer focus that has dominated social marketing. Future research could use the approach in this paper to derive short diagnostic tools with a broader range of behavioural contexts and with more diverse populations. Limitations: The behavioural measures used in these studies were self-report measures, and the use of a more objective measure would further strengthen both the segmentation analysis and short diagnostic tool."

Design/methodology/approach: Combining database (i.e. Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, ScienceDirect) and manual journal search, the authors identify 90 articles published in Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) journals for investigation, using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics and Methodology) framework. Findings: The results indicate a split between data-driven and theory-driven research, with most studies either adopting an experimental research design focused on testing the accuracy and performance of AI algorithms to assist with credit scoring or investigating AI consumer adoption behaviors in a banking context. The authors call for more research building overarching theories or extending existing theoretical perspectives, such as actor networks. More empirical research is required, especially focusing on consumers' financial behaviors as well as the role of regulation, ethics and policy concerned with AI in financial service contexts, such as insurance or pensions. Research limitations/implications: The review focuses on AI in customer-facing financial services. Future work may want to investigate back-office and operations contexts. Originality/value: The authors are the first to systematically synthesize the literature on the use of AI in customer-facing financial services, offering a valuable agenda for future research."

All rights reserved.This study investigates the manufacturer's preferences between reselling, fulfillment by pop (FBP), sales on pop (SOP), reselling & FBP, reselling & SOP. We stylized the e-commerce supply chain models without data-driven marketing (DDM) and with DDM, and characterize the manufacturer's optimal sales mode. Result shows that whether there is DDM or not, the profit obtained by agency selling is always lower than reselling & agency selling, so FBP and SOP are always excluded as strict disadvantages. When there is no DDM, only when the commission rate and unit sales cost are large, the manufacturer selects reselling. On the contrary, the manufacturer selects reselling & agency selling with relatively low unit sales cost. Contrary to intuition, when the efficiency of DDM is high, low commission rate will induce manufacturer to choose reselling mode, and high commission rate will make manufacturer tend to reselling & agency selling. Finally, we analyze the change in the profit growth rate of manufacturer and platform, as well as the amount of consumer surplus and social welfare through numerical simulation."
85137239741,Green R&amp;D Financing Strategy in Platform Supply Chain with Data-Driven Marketing,Xia Y.,Sustainability (Switzerland),2022-08-01,10.3390/su14159172,3,Qingdao University,Article,"© 2022 by the authors.Platform enterprises can improve green R&D efficiency by data-driven marketing (DDM) activities and can also provide financing assistance to manufacturers. In this context, for a platform supply chain consisting of one manufacturer facing a shortage of green R&D funds and a one third-party platform, this paper develops four game models under two financing channels (bank financing channel and platform financing channel) and two selling modes (agency selling mode and reselling mode). The equilibrium results of different models are derived and compared, and then the choices of selling mode and financing channel from the perspectives of both the manufacturer and the platform are analyzed. The conclusions show that the consumers’ sensitivities to green R&D and DDM activities, as well as service commission fee, are major factors influencing green R&D level and both parties’ choice of selling mode and financing channel. In most cases, a platform financing channel can promote the green R&D level better and is more beneficial to the manufacturer and the platform. Only in a few cases, the two parties prefer the reselling mode and bank financing channel. However, agent selling with bank financing will never be their optimal strategy. There exists four situations in which the manufacturer and the platform can agree on a same strategy on selling mode and financing channel."

Therefore, we have modeled a platform supply chain using game theory, in which the manufacturer conducts green research and development (R&D) activities, the third-party platform conducts data-driven marketing (DDM) activities to promote green products, and all consumers have green preferences. The numerical example and empirical analysis methods are used to mine management insights. The government subsidizes the manufacturer’s green R&D, the third-party platform’s DDM, and the consumers’ green consumption. The third-party platform provides an agency selling or reselling strategy to sell products. Our results show that: (1) the sensitivity coefficient of consumers to green R&D and DDM activities has positive impacts on all members’ profits and on the green R&D level of products in the platform supply chain, with three kinds of government subsidy policies. (2) The levels of the three kinds of government subsidies mainly have an impact on all members’ profits and on the green R&D level of products in the platform supply chain with an agency selling or reselling strategy; government subsidies to the manufacturer are more conducive to improving the green R&D level of products. (3) The levels of the three government subsidies and the unit service commissioning fee for selling products are the main factors affecting the preferred selling strategy of each member and the equilibrium of the selling strategy."

This volatility causes inefficiencies in the allocation of a destination’s resources. Policy makers and operators prefer a steady and constant inflow of tourists. Though prior studies have applied a portfolio optimization approach to inbound tourism flows, this study is the first to consider the destination’s marketing budget and each tourism markets’ heterogeneous marketing expenditure–demand elasticity. Our model provides destination marketing organizations with direct guidance as to how to allocate their marketing budget to facilitate portfolio profiles that are efficient from a risk-reward perspective, and that are attainable given budget constraints and known marketing expenditure–demand elasticity patterns. Using Tourism Research Australia International Visitor Survey data, we find that variability in tourism fluctuations can be reduced and inbound tourism numbers/spending significantly increased by implementing smarter (data-driven) marketing budget allocations."

All rights reserved.[Objective] This study investigates the similarities and differences between the projected image by official marketing activities and the perceived image by user generated contents. [Methods] First, we retrieved marketing data of festival events and related user generated contents with a web crawler. Then, we used the grounded theory to construct the model for festival event images. Third, we utilized compositional distance analysis to examine the distance between the projected and perceived images. Finally, we collected quantitative data to evaluate the proposed model and the compositional distance analysis results. [Results] We found that festival images had three dimensions of event, social, and location. Compositional distance of the location dimension is the largest, while the social dimension is the smallest. [Limitations] We only collected data from the Strawberry Music Festival. More research is needed to examine the proposed model with other festival events. [Conclusions] This research provides an effective data-driven method for tracking and analyzing official marketing strategies, i.e. the difference between the projected and the perceived images."
85132823142,Iterative Mixed Method Approach to B2B SaaS User Personas,Boyle R.E.,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,2022-06-17,10.1145/3534523,2,LiveRamp,Article,"© 2022 ACM.User persona research has primarily been done on Business-To-Consumer (B2C) products, generated hybridly with interviews or surveys or purely quantitatively through clickstream data, often to serve sales / marketing teams. However, the application of these approaches in different circumstances to this is still relatively novel. How can we segment users in a way that is both helpful and accurate for a Business-To-Business (B2B) Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) product and its product development stakeholders, for a product with ""imperfect""/ obfuscated product analytics data and disjointed user journeys? We performed an iterative, qualitative and mixed quantitative approach to user personas that utilized survey data, user interviews, and preprocessed / manipulated web analytics data to provide a complete picture of the user. Survey data provided user background and insight into who to recruit while interviews provided insight into user journeys, personalities, and pain points. Using dimensionality reduction and an iterative clustering approach informed by survey and interview insights, we generated clusters based on users' time per page and clicks per feature data from our web analytics. Diving into the data behind each cluster and triangulating with interview and survey data enabled us to identify six distinct user personas. We recommend our approach to user segmentation, an as yet unexplored combination of qualitative and mixed quantitative methods, for the research teams of other mid-sized B2B SaaS companies as a way to address domain-specific challenges and bridge the data and user journeys gaps to paint a full, accurate picture of the user."
85134062133,The Effect of Using Data Pre-Processing by Imputations in Handling Missing Values,Karrar A.E.,Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,2022-06-01,10.52549/ijeei.v10i2.3730,4,Taibah University,Article,"© 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.The evolution of big data analytics through machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques has caused organizations in a wide range of sectors including health, manufacturing, e-commerce, governance, and social welfare to realize the value of massive volumes of data accumulating on web-based repositories daily. This has led to the adoption of data-driven decision models; for example, through sentiment analysis in marketing where produces leverage customer feedback and reviews to develop customer-oriented products. However, the data generated in real-world activities is subject to errors resulting from inaccurate measurements or fault input devices, which may result in the loss of some values. Missing attribute/variable values make data unsuitable for decision analytics due to noises and inconsistencies that create bias. The objective of this paper was to explore the problem of missing data and develop an advanced imputation model based on Machine Learning and implemented on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm in R programming language as an approach to handle missing values. The methodology used in this paper relied on the applying advanced machine learning algorithms with high-level accuracy in pattern detection and predictive analytics on the existing imputation techniques, which handle missing values by random replacement or deletion.. According to the results, advanced imputation technique based on machine learning models replaced missing values from a dataset with 89.5% accuracy. The experimental results showed that pre-processing by imputation delivers high-level performance efficiency in handling missing data values. These findings are consistent with the key idea of paper, which is to explore alternative imputation techniques for handling missing values to improve the accuracy and reliability of decision insights extracted from datasets."

Method: A qualitative interview study was conducted with a volunteer sample of 14 community first responders in two regions of Sweden. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis with a data-driven inductive approach supported by NVivo 1.3. Results: The responders’ experiences were illustrated in three main themes, each including several subthemes: 1) Profound wish to help, including the sense of importance and sense of emergency; 2) Facing the situation, including essential actions performed in collaboration, confidence from training and experience, challenges posed by unforeseen situations and ethical dilemmas, and coping with emotional reactions; and 3) Potential for improvements, including technical and communication development, feedback and debriefing, training and social marketing. Conclusion: The community first responders were motivated and eager to help but simultaneously feared the mission and were not always prepared for their own reactions in the emergency when dispatched. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation training and experience gave them skills that enabled them to act constructively, they faced situations that might be facilitated by improvements in the community first responder system and further training. The responders were proud of their efforts and were good ambassadors for the system. Appreciation of their commitment, better preparation and providing support in the aftermath of an emergency appears to be a good investment in societies’ efforts to bring quick help to distressed persons."
85129502104,Approximate Algorithms for Data-Driven Influence Limitation,Medya S.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2022-06-01,10.1109/TKDE.2020.3016293,5,Kellogg School of Management Northwestern University,Article,"© 1989-2012 IEEE.Online social networks have become major battlegrounds for political campaigns, viral marketing, and the dissemination of news. As a consequence, 'bad actors' are increasingly exploiting these platforms, which is a key challenge for their administrators, businesses and society in general. The spread of fake news is a classical example of the abuse of social networks by these bad actors. While some have advocated for stricter policies to control the spread of misinformation in social networks, this often happens in detriment of their democratic and organic structure. In this paper, we aim to limit the influence of a target group in a social network via the removal of a few users/links. We formulate the influence limitation problem in a data-driven fashion, by taking into account past propagation traces. More specifically, our algorithms find critical edges to be removed in order to decrease the influence of a target group based on past data. The idea is to control the diffusion processes while minimizing the amount of disturbance in the network structure. Moreover, we consider two types of constraints over edge removals, a budget constraint and also a, more general, set of matroid constraints. These problems lead to interesting challenges in terms of algorithm design. For instance, we are able to show that influence limitation is APX-hard and propose deterministic and probabilistic approximation algorithms for the budgeted and the matroid version of the problem, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed approaches outperform several baselines."

Instead, digital vulnerability describes a universal state of defencelessness and susceptibility to (the exploitation of) power imbalances that are the result of the increasing automation of commerce, datafied consumer–seller relations, and the very architecture of digital marketplaces. Digital vulnerability, we argue, is architectural, relational, and data-driven. Based on our concept of digital vulnerability, we demonstrate how and why using digital technology to render consumers vulnerable is the epitome of an unfair digital commercial practice."

Recent empirical studies have analyzed the differences and complexity of information dissemination, but theoretical explanations of its characteristics from a modeling perspective are underresearched. To capture the complex patterns of the information dissemination mechanism, we propose a resistant linear threshold (RLT) dissemination model based on psychological theories and empirical findings. In this article, we validate the RLT model on three types of networks and then quantify and compare the dissemination characteristics of the simulation results with those from the empirical results. In addition, we examine the factors affecting dissemination. Finally, we perform two case studies of the 2019 novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)-related information dissemination. The dissemination characteristics derived by the simulations are consistent with the empirical research. These results demonstrate that the RLT model is able to capture the patterns of information dissemination on social media and thus provide model-driven insights into the interpretation of public opinion, rumor control, and marketing strategies on social media."

Recently, data-driven predictions have attracted interest in high-stakes decision-making. Despite this, advanced AI methods are less often used for such tasks. This is because AI technology is a black box for the social systems it is meant to support; trustworthiness and fairness have not yet been established. Meanwhile in the field of marketing, strategic decision-making is a high-stakes problem that has a significant impact on business trends. For global marketing, with its diverse cultures and market environments, future decision-making is likely to focus on building consensus on the formulation of the problem itself rather than on solutions for achieving the goal. There are two important and conflicting facts: the fact that the core of domestic strategic decision-making comes down to the formulation of the problem itself, and the fact that it is difficult to realize AI technology that can achieve problem formulation. How can we resolve this difficulty with current technology? This is the main challenge for the realization of high-level human-AI systems in the marketing field. Thus, we propose customer journey mapping (CJM) automation through model-level data fusion, a process for the practical problem formulation known as explainable alignment. Using domain-specific requirements and observations as inputs, the system automatically outputs a CJM. Explainable alignment corresponds with both human and AI perspectives and in formulating the problem, thereby improving strategic decision-making in marketing. Following preprocessing to make latent variables and their dynamics transparent with latent Dirichlet allocation and a variational autoencoder, a post-hoc explanation is implemented in which a hidden Markov model and learning from an interpretation transition are combined with a long short-term memory architecture that learns sequential data between touchpoints for extracting attitude rules for CJM. Finally, we realize the application of human-AI systems to strategic decision-making in marketing with actual logs in over-the-top media services, in which the dynamic behavior of customers for CJM can be automatically extracted."
85124946513,Are longer reviews always more helpful? Disentangling the interplay between review length and line of argumentation,Lutz B.,Journal of Business Research,2022-05-01,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.02.010,19,Universität Freiburg,Article,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.An overwhelming majority of previous works find longer product reviews to be more helpful than short reviews. In this paper, we build upon information overload theory and propose that longer reviews should not be assumed to be uniformly more helpful; instead, we argue that the effect depends on the complexity of the line of argumentation. To test this idea, we implement state-of-the-art machine learning methods that allow us to study the line of argumentation in reviews at the sentence-level. Our empirical analysis based on a dataset of Amazon customer reviews suggests that line of argumentation and review length are closely intertwined such that longer reviews with frequent changes between positive and negative arguments are perceived as less helpful. Our work has important implications for marketing professionals and retailer platforms that can utilize our results to optimize their customer feedback systems, enhance reviewer guidelines, and include more useful product reviews."
85115309325,Data-Driven Variable Decomposition for Treatment Effect Estimation,Kuang K.,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2022-05-01,10.1109/TKDE.2020.3006898,8,"College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University",Article,"© 1989-2012 IEEE.Causal Inference plays an important role in decision making in many fields, such as social marketing, healthcare, and public policy. One fundamental problem in causal inference is the treatment effect estimation in observational studies when variables are confounded. Controlling for confounding effects is generally handled by propensity score. But it treats all observed variables as confounders and ignores the adjustment variables, which have no influence on treatment but are predictive of the outcome. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the adjustment variables are effective in reducing the variance of the estimated treatment effect. However, how to automatically separate the confounders and adjustment variables in observational studies is still an open problem, especially in the scenarios of high dimensional variables, which are common in the big data era. In this paper, we first propose a Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$2VD) algorithm, which can 1) automatically separate confounders and adjustment variables with a data-driven approach, and 2) simultaneously estimate treatment effect in observational studies with high dimensional variables. Under standard assumptions, we theoretically prove that our D$^2$2VD algorithm can unbiased estimate treatment effect and achieve lower variance than traditional propensity score based methods. Moreover, to address the challenges from high-dimensional variables and nonlinear, we extend our D$^2$2VD to a non-linear version, namely Nonlinear-D$^2$2VD (N-D$^2$2VD) algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our D$^2$2VD and N-D$^2$2VD algorithms can automatically separate the variables precisely, and estimate treatment effect more accurately and with tighter confidence intervals than the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrated that the top-ranked features by our algorithm have the best prediction performance on an online advertising dataset."

Given an advertisement query and a set of outdoor billboards with different spatial locations and rental prices, our goal is to find a subset of billboards, such that the total targeted influence is maximum under a limited budget constraint. To achieve this goal, we are facing two challenges: (1) it is difficult to estimate targeted advertising influence in physical world; (2) due to NP hardness, many common search techniques fail to provide a satisfied solution with an acceptable time, especially for large-scale problem settings. Taking into account the exposure strength, advertisement matching degree, and advertising repetition effect, we first build a targeted influence model that can characterize that the advertising influence spreads along with users mobility. Subsequently, based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, we develop two effective approaches, i.e., a master-slave-based sequential optimization method, TOAR-MSS, and a cooperative co-evolution-based optimization method, TOAR-CC, to solve our studied problem. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Details on building levels play an essential part in a number of real-world application models. Energy systems, telecommunications, disaster management, the internet-of-things, health care, and marketing are a few of the many applications that require building information. The essential variables that most of these models require are building type, house type, area of living space, and number of residents. In order to acquire some of this information, this paper introduces a methodology and generates corresponding data. The study was conducted for specific applications in energy system modeling. Nonetheless, these data can also be used in other applications. Building locations and some of their details are openly available in the form of map data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, data regarding building types (i.e., residential, industrial, office, single-family house, multi-family house, etc.) are only partially available in the OSM dataset. Therefore, a machine learning classification algorithm for predicting the building types on the basis of the OSM buildings’ data was introduced. Although the OSM dataset is the fundamental and most crucial one used for modeling, the machine learning algorithm’s training was performed on a dataset that was prepared by combining several features from three other datasets. The generated dataset consists of approx-imately 29 million buildings, of which about 19 million are residential, with 72% being single-family houses and the rest multi-family ones that include two-family houses and apartment buildings. Furthermore, the results were validated through a comparison with publicly available statistical data. The comparison of the resulting data with official statistics reveals that there is a percentage error of 3.64% for residential buildings, 13.14% for single-family houses, and −15.38% for multi-family houses classification. Nevertheless, by incorporating the building types, this dataset is able to complement existing building information in studies in which building type information is cru-cial."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Vertical farming (VF) is a newer crop production practice that is attracting attention from all around the world. VF is defined as growing indoor crops on multiple layers, either on the same floor or on multiple stories. Most VF operations are located in urban environments, substantially reducing the distance between producer and consumer. Some people claim that VF is the beginning of a new era in controlled environment agriculture, with the potential to substantially increase resource-use efficiencies. However, since most vertical farms exclusively use electric lighting to grow crops, the energy input for VF is typically very high. Additional challenges include finding and converting growing space, constructing growing systems, maintaining equipment, selecting suitable plant species, maintaining a disease-and pest-free environment, attracting and training workers, optimizing the control of environmental parameters, managing data-driven decision making, and marketing. The objective of the paper is to highlight several of the challenges and issues associated with planning and operating a successful vertical farm. Industry-specific information and knowledge will help investors and growers make informed decisions about financing and operating a vertical farm."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Expanding green consumption market and precise data promotion advantages make the platform economy have a significant effect on influencing manufacturers to carry out green R&D and production activities, and government subsidies have a positive incentive effect. In this context, for the studies about platform supply chain management with manufacturer’s green production and the platform’s marketing activities simultaneously are rare, we consider that a manufacturer invests in green technologies to produce products and sell them through a smart platform supply chain by an agency selling or reselling strategy, in which the platform provides data-driven marketing technology to promote green products. Four game models are constructed to study the operational efficiency of the platform supply chain considering selling strategy difference and government subsidy. The results show that: (1) The manufacturer’s green technology and the platform’s data-driven marketing levels, as well as all member’s profits are all influenced by the potential market demand of green products, the sensitivities of consumers to green product attributes, and data analysis technology. (2) The service commission rate charged by the platform plays a main role on the manufacturer’s selling strategy choice, when the service commission rate is low, the manufacturer chooses an agency selling strategy and can obtain more profit, but now the green technology level is not necessarily better than that in the reselling system. With the service commission rate increases, a manufacturer that chooses the reselling strategy can obtain more profit, and the green technology level is better than in the agency selling system. (3) Government subsidy can effectively encourage the manufacturer to improve the green technology level, and now the platform will improve the data-driven marketing level. There is a threshold range of the service commission rate charged by the platform in which the government can guide the manufacturer and the platform to reach an equilibrium selling strategy by regulating the subsidy level."

A dynamic perspective on how data-driven start-ups strategize across different network roles in digitalized business networks,Mosch P.,Industrial Marketing Management,2022-04-01,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.01.023,10,Universität Passau,Article,"© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Digitalization transforms how actors conduct activities and exchange resources in business networks. Data-driven start-ups are key actors in this transformation as they are often the first to commercialize novel digital technologies and influence business networks through their strategizing. Extant Industrial Marketing & Purchasing (IMP) literature has investigated roles and strategizing in business networks. However, understanding how data-driven start-ups' specificities impact their roles and strategizing is still at its infancy. Specifically, the authors conceptually show that assumptions on how data-driven start-ups strategize contradict strategizing tenets of prior IMP literature. Therefore, previous knowledge on strategizing needs further differentiation. Addressing this research need, theories-in-use and multiple case study research on 23 data-driven start-ups is conducted to examine (1) in what network roles they operate and (2) how they strategize within and across different network roles. The study extends IMP and data-driven business model research by identifying four network roles (enabler, extender, transformer, orchestrator) and developing a specific classification framework for data-driven start-ups. Furthermore, the study shows that IMP tenets apply in specific network roles only to some extent to data-driven start-ups. Finally, three strategizing trajectories are identified, which provide a dynamic perspective to IMP literature for guiding entrepreneurs on strategizing opportunities."

In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance. In addition, HMDM and AAI are also proposed for firms to optimise FCMP."

Although randomized “geo experiments” are frequently employed for this evaluation, obtaining reliable estimates of iROAS can be challenging, as oftentimes only a small number of highly heterogeneous units are used. Moreover, advertisers frequently impose budget constraints on their ad spends which further complicates causal inference by introducing interference between the experimental units. In this paper we formulate a novel statistical framework for inferring the iROAS of online advertising from randomized paired geo experiment, which further motivates and provides new insights into Rosenbaum’s arguments on instrumental variables, and we propose and develop a robust, distribution-free and interpretable estimator “Trimmed Match” as well as a data-driven choice of the tuning parameter which may be of independent interest. We investigate the sensitivity of Trimmed Match to some violations of its assumptions and show that it can be more efficient than some alternative estimators based on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility with real case studies."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As smartphone segments have become more complex in recent times, the importance of personas for designing and marketing has increased. Earlier, designers focused on traditional qualitative personas but have been criticised for the lack of evidence and outdated results. However, although several methods of quantitative persona creation have been developed over the last few years, the use of mobile application store data has not yet been studied. In this research, we propose a framework using work domain analysis to help designers and marketers to build personas easily from mobile phone application store data. We considered the top 100 applications, which were ranked based on the number of devices using each application, how often each application was used, and the usage time. After proposing a new framework, we analysed data from a mobile application store in January and August 2020. We then created quantitative personas based on the data and discussed with experts whether the created personas successfully reflected real changes in mobile application trends."

In marketing, the value behind data relates to the power of encoding customer preferences: the better you know your customer, the better your marketing strategy. In this paper, we present a B2B2C lead generation application based on payment transaction data within the online banking system. In this approach, the bank is an intermediary between its private customers and merchants. The bank uses its competence in Machine Learning driven marketing to build a lead generation application that helps merchants run data driven campaigns through the banking channels to reach retail customers.

85124771134,Cross-channel effects of omnichannel retail marketing strategies: A review of extant data-driven research,Timoumi A.,Journal of Retailing,2022-03-01,10.1016/j.jretai.2022.02.008,49,Indian School of Business,Article,"© 2022The authors review 50 empirical retailing research papers that have appeared over the last 20 years to take stock of what we know, need to know better, and do not know yet about within-retailer cross-channel effects of omnichannel retail marketing strategies on (a) consumer responses over their purchase journeys, i.e., online and/or offline search, purchase intention, frequency, amount, returns, loyalty, and (b) the retail firm's aggregate outcomes (e.g., sales, costs, profits, product returns) by channel and overall. Specifically, the authors focus on five strategies: (1) the addition of online channel by an offline retailer; (2) the addition (or subtraction) of offline channels by an online retailer; (3) addition of mobile shopping channel (website and/or app) by offline and/or online retailer; (4) cross-channel integration strategies; and (5) retail marketing mix strategies. The author/s integrate findings from empirical research on these strategies into a number of ‘insights’ about ‘what we know’. Prominent among these are the following: Adding a transactional online channel to an offline channel improves the retailer's overall sales even though offline channel sales can be cannibalized to some degree. Adding an offline channel by an online retailer, however, boosts online channel sales as well as overall sales of the retailer. Similarly, adding a mobile shopping channel usually increases customer purchase frequency and amount and overall sales of the retailer in the long-term. Strategies for greater cross-channel integration generally have a positive effect on a retailer's overall performance while online advertising has positive effects on offline channel consideration and sales as well as overall sales of a multichannel retailer. Other insights or findings that need further study or open questions are also identified. The paper closes with managerial implications of the derived empirical insights, and suggestions for future research."

In other domains, such as manufacturing and design, frameworks have been developed using data-driven analytic processes to extract customer preferences and expectations to inform product development. This study builds from approaches to understanding customer satisfaction in other domains to investigate the potential of social media review mining for bridging the gap between understanding of neighborhood livability and conventional transportation planning decision-making practices. The novelty of the approach is in interpreting an automated user-defined translation of qualitative measures of livability by evaluating users' satisfaction of the neighborhoods through social media and enhancing the traditional approaches to defining livability planning measures (through a sentiment analysis and visualization package). The provided data-driven neighborhood satisfaction package draws the marketing structure of transportation network elements (analogous to the ‘products’ in other domains) with residential nodes as the center of the structure. In this study, the FastText algorithm is tested to employ a social review analysis, common neighborhood aspects are annotated, and neighborhood satisfaction is visualized and compared to the associated demographic side information. Through extracting the important aspects of the public concerns, advanced visualization helps transportation planners better understand the implications for community livability and provides insight into an approach for conducting more equitable public outreach. This approach has the potential to capitalize on residents' interests in social media outlets and to increase public engagement in the planning process by encouraging users to participate in online neighborhood satisfaction reporting. This study demonstrates a proof of concept for a social review analysis and specifies the methodology for agencies to augment planning performance management. (word count: 273)."

Game revenue forecast is vital to game developers to make the right business decisions, such as determining the marketing budget, controlling the development cost, and setting up benchmarks for evaluating game publishing performance. How to make the revenue forecast and integrate it with the game publishing process is hard for small and medium-sized independent (indie) game developers. This includes all steps of the process, from forecasting to decision-making based on the results. This paper provides a data-driven method that uses the mobile game revenue forecast based on different time-series prediction models to drive the game publishing. We demonstrate how to use the data-driven method to guide an indie game studio to forecast revenue and then set the revenue forecast as the internal benchmark to drive game publishing. In practice, we involve a real game project from an indie game studio and provide guidance for one of their casual game projects. Then, based on the revenue forecast, we discuss how to set the revenue forecast as an internal benchmark and drive the actions for mobile game publishing. Finally, we make a conclusion on how our data-driven method can be used to drive mobile game publishing and also discuss future research work."

To reduce this complexity, they have introduced category management practices, which consider groups of similar products (categories) that can be managed separately as single business units (SBUs). Although the concept that the store offer should be organised as a category mix and that this strategy allows for better overall store management is already consolidated, retailers still struggle to adopt an approach to the store performance measurement starting from a category level perspective. Nowadays, the available methods for measuring categories’ performance are quite limited. The current trend sees the measurement of category performance mainly based on sell-out data that are ill-equipped to fully address category management issues. Retailers should broaden their field of analysis not only by focusing on the product/sales perspective but also by including other methodologies such as shopper behaviour analysis. In this regard, the use of technology offers the retail sector new perspectives for those analysis. Therefore, we intend to contribute to the ongoing debate on the retail analytics topic by presenting a shopper behaviour analytics system for category management performance monitoring. More in detail, we could derive a new key performance indicator, category conversion power (CCP), aimed at analysing and comparing the single categories organised within the store. The research is based on a unique dataset obtained from a real-time locating system (RTLS), which allowed us to collect behavioural data togheter with sell-out data (from POS scanner). We argue that retailers could exploit this new analytical method to gain more understanding at the category level and therefore make data-driven decisions aimed at improving performance at the store level."

To study the consumers’ attitude about the BDPD, this study constructed a semantic recognition frame to deconstruct the Affection-Behavior-Cognition (ABC) consumer attitude theory using machine learning models inclusive of the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Snow Natural Language Processing (NLP), based on social media comments text dataset. Similar to the questionnaires published results, this article verified that 61% of consumers expressed negative sentiment toward BDPD in general. Differently, on a finer scale, this study further measured the negative sentiments that differ significantly among different topics. The measurement results show that the topics “Regular Customers Priced High” (69%) and “Usage Intention” (67%) occupy the top two places of negative sentiment among consumers, and the topic “Precision Marketing” (42%) is at the bottom. Moreover, semantic recognition results that 49% of consumers’ comments involve multiple topics, indicating that consumers have a pretty clear cognition of the complex status of the BDPD. Importantly, this study found some topics that had not been focused on in previous studies, such as more than 8% of consumers calling for government and legal departments to regulate BDPD behavior, which indicates that quite enough consumers are losing confidence in the self-discipline of the platform enterprises. Another interesting result is that consumers who pursue solutions to the BDPD belong to two mutually exclusive groups: government protection and self-protection. The significance of this study is that it reminds the e-commerce platforms to pay attention to the potential harm for consumers’ psychology while bringing additional profits through the BDPD. Otherwise, the negative consumer attitudes may cause damage to brand image, business reputation, and the sustainable development of the platforms themselves. It also provides the government supervision departments an advanced analysis method reference for more effective administration to protect social fairness."

Health care has slowly started leveraging big data analysis to identify more cost-efficient and effective care for patients. Business intelligence software aims to help with this transition, converting large data sets into useful, actionable information. Radiology practices have used business intelligence toolkits in the past to increase reading room productivity, scanner efficiency, and patient throughput. Although these tactics have driven down costs and increased volumes, an essential aspect of radiology practice growth—consumer satisfaction—remains largely unexplored. The first commandment of marketing is “know thy customer,” which is the key to increasing radiology's value to referring clinicians who use our services. Our article explores the business case behind a basic business intelligence model, giving any radiologist the instruments to access and draw business conclusions from their radiology information system data."
85107412149,Predictive analytics for customer repurchase: Interdisciplinary integration of buy till you die modeling and machine learning,Chou P.,European Journal of Operational Research,2022-01-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2021.04.021,22,National Chengchi University,Article,"© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Predicting customer repurchase propensity/frequency has received broad research interests from marketing, operations research, statistics, and computer science. In the field of marketing, Buy till You Die (BTYD) models are perhaps the most representative techniques for customer repurchase prediction. Those probabilistic models are parsimonious and typically involve only recency and frequency of customer activities. Contrary to BTYD models, a distinctly different class of predictive models for customer repurchase is machine learning. This class of models include a wide variety of computational and statistical learning algorithms. Unlike BTYD models built on low-dimensional inputs and behavioral assumptions, machine learning is more data-driven and excels at fitting predictive models to a large array of features from customer transactions. Using a large online retailing data, we empirically assess the prediction performance of BTYD modeling and machine learning. More importantly, we investigate how the two approaches can complement each other for repurchase prediction. We use the BG/BB model given the discrete and non-contractual problem setting and incorporate BG/BB estimates into high-dimensional Lasso regression. In addition to showing significant improvement over BG/BB and Lasso without BG/BB, the integrated Lasso-BG/BB provides interpretability and identifies BG/BB predictions as the most influential feature among ∼100 predictors. The lately developed CART-artificial neural networks exhibit similar patterns. Robustness checks further show the proposed Lasso-BG/BB outperforms two sophisticated recurrent neural networks, validating the complementarity of machine learning and BTYD modeling. We conclude by articulating how our interdisciplinary integration of the two modeling paradigms contributes to the theory and practice of predictive analytics."

Published by AnaPub Publications.In order to generate precise behavioural patterns or user segmentation, organisations often struggle with pulling information from data and choosing suitable Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Furthermore, many marketing teams are unfamiliar with data-driven classification methods. The goal of this research is to provide a framework that outlines the Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML) methods for User-Profiling (UP) based on essential data attributes. A thorough literature study was undertaken on the most popular UML techniques and their dataset attributes needs. For UP, a structure is developed that outlines several UML techniques. In terms of data size and dimensions, it offers two-stage clustering algorithms for category, quantitative, and mixed types of datasets. The clusters are determined in the first step using a multilevel or model-based classification method. Cluster refining is done in the second step using a non-hierarchical clustering technique. Academics and professionals may use the framework to figure out which UML techniques are best for creating strong profiles or data-driven user segmentation."

Innovative research on marketing models can help the transformation and development of small and medium-sized e-commerce companies, which has important practical significance and theoretical value. The prediction of e-commerce sales is one of the key aspects of the evaluation of innovative marketing models, and only an accurate prediction of future sales can lead to a reasonable marketing plan. Therefore, a big data-driven e-commerce sales forecasting method is proposed. First of all, for 1703 real e-commerce companies, a large number of relevant data that affect sales are selected, including sales records, product information, product evaluation, and other information. A knowledge graph was then used to preprocess the data samples to produce a sample set containing concepts, entities, and relationships. Next, the knowledge graph K-modes clustering model is established. By fixing the affiliation matrix and the clustering cluster matrix in turn, the minimum of the objective function is continuously solved to obtain the cluster centres. Finally, sales prediction is achieved based on the clustering results. The experimental results show that the proposed clustering model is able to obtain better performance in terms of cluster purity, NMI, and F-value. The proposed clustering model has high sales prediction accuracy and has certain reference value for e-commerce enterprises of different scales to formulate innovative marketing models."

This restricts organizations to realize the business value of recommender systems as they have to incur marketing and operations costs to engage new users and promote new items. Owing to this, several studies have been done by recommender systems researchers to address the cold start problems. However, there has been very limited recent research done on collating these approaches and algorithms. To address this gap, the paper conducts a systematic literature review of various strategies and approaches proposed by researchers in the last decade, from January 2010 to December 2021, and synthesizes the same into two categories: data-driven strategies and approach-driven strategies. Furthermore, the approach-driven strategies are categorized into five main clusters based on deep learning, matrix factorization, hybrid approaches, or other novel approaches in collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms. The scope of this study is limited to a systematic literature review and it does not include an experimental study to benchmark and recommend the best approaches and their context of use in cold start scenarios."

Freeman School of Business,Article,"© 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences. All rights reserved.Explosive growth in the number of users on various social media platforms has transformed the way firms strategize their marketing activities. To take advantage of the vast size of social networks, firms have now turned their attention to influencer marketing wherein they employ independent influencers to promote their products on social media platforms. Despite the recent growth in influencer marketing, the problem of network seeding (i.e., identification of influencers to optimally post a firm's message or advertisement) neither has been rigorously studied in the academic literature nor has been carefully addressed in practice. We develop a data-driven optimization framework to help a firm successfully conduct (i) short-horizon and (ii) long-horizon influencer marketing campaigns, for which two models are developed, respectively, to maximize the firm's benefit. The models are based on the interactions with marketers, observation of firms' message placements on social media, and model parameters estimated via empirical analysis performed on data from Twitter. Our empirical analysis discovers the effects of collective influence of multiple influencers and finds two important parameters to be included in the models, namely, multiple exposure effect and forgetting effect. For the short-horizon campaign, we develop an optimization model to select influencers and present structural properties for the model. Using these properties, we develop a mathematical programming based polynomial time procedure to provide near-optimal solutions. For the long-horizon problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure to simultaneously select influencers and schedule their message postings over a planning horizon. We demonstrate the superiority of our solution strategies for both short- and longhorizon problems against multiple benchmark methods used in practice. Finally, we present several managerially relevant insights for firms in the influencer marketing context."

The purpose of this article is to show how a comprehensive marketing model, the NBD-Dirichlet, can be used to construct coherent and integrated dashboards. This is demonstrated using an example that offers practical guidance to practitioners and researchers for incorporating the model into a dashboard and showing how it can enhance visualisation, communication, and decision-making. The example concerns digital media consumption behaviour, specifically the section choice behaviour of readers of an online magazine. The example demonstrates the utility of the NBD-Dirichlet model to underpin a marketing management dashboard (RQ1), where model parameters are estimated from unstructured log-file data (RQ2) using log-likelihood estimation (RQ4). The example also shows the applicability of the model in analysing a non-brand attribute, specifically magazine content sections (RQ3). From inspection of graphical and tabular dashboards, it is evident that magazine section content is read by consumers in ways we might expect given the well-known Double Jeopardy (DJ) pattern of the NBD-Dirichlet model (RQ5). There is no evidence of change-of-pace behavioural loyalty (RQ6), nor niche behavioural loyalty (RQ7). Finally, the article highlights the benefits of the NBD-Dirichlet in business as not only a tool for underpinning dashboards but also for scenario planning (RQ8)."

Although data-driven innovation has been proved effective in creating value across many business functions, the pace of adoption of strong data ecosystems seems slower for Arts and Cultural Organizations (ACOs). The paper theoretically explores how data analytics can affect different areas of innovation in the core cultural sectors. By integrating marketing intelligence, arts management and policy literature with illustrative evidence from secondary sources, we discuss the potential impact of data analytics for enhancing ACOs innovation. First, digitalization and connectivity have increased opportunities for customer engagement and empowerment, shifting cultural consumption from a transaction to a relationship with cultural organizations. Second, data-driven metrics allow ACOs and policy makers to match more effectively patterns of consumption and eventually to create value from harvesting and processing information. Finally, although ACOs are encouraged to review their traditional business models through this new trajectory, significant conceptual and organizational barriers question the benefits of data analytics and slow down its adoption. The paper contributes to the academic and policy debate on the role of data-driven innovation in arts management and marketing strategies for cultural organizations."
85122187903,Narrowing the Feedback Gap: Examining Student Engagement with Personalized and Actionable Feedback Messages,Iraj H.,Journal of Learning Analytics,2021-12-15,10.18608/jla.2021.7184,13,University of South Australia,Article,"© 2021, UTS ePRESS. All rights reserved.One of the major factors affecting student learning is feedback. Although the importance of feedback has been recognized in educational institutions, dramatic changes—such as bigger class sizes and a more diverse student population—challenged the provision of effective feedback. In light of these changes, educators have increasingly been using new digital tools to provide student feedback, given the broader adoption and availability of these new technologies. However, despite these efforts, most educators have limited insight into the recipience of their feedback and wonder which students engage with feedback. This problem is referred to as the “feedback gap,” which is the difference between the potential and actual use of feedback, preventing educators and instructional designers from understanding feedback recipience among students. In this study, a set of trackable call-to-action (CTA) links were embedded in feedback messages focused on learning processes and self-regulation of learning in one fully online marketing course and one blended bioscience course. These links helped us examine the association between feedback engagement and course success. We also conducted two focus groups with students from one of the courses to further examine student perceptions of feedback messages. Our results across both courses revealed that early engagement with feedback is positively associated with passing the course and that most students considered feedback messages helpful in their learning. Our study also found some interesting demographic differences between students regarding their engagement with the feedback messages. Such insight enables instructors to ask “why” questions, support students’ learning, improve feedback processes, and narrow the gap between potential and actual use of feedback. The practical implications of our findings are further discussed."

All right reserved.Research background: With growing evidence of consumer adoption of mobile shopping apps, there is a pivotal need for comprehending Internet-enabled consumer devices in mobile shopping behavior. Mobile shopping platform features and user technological readiness configure consumers' expectations and demands as regards mobile retailing adoption, leading to acceptance of mobile shopping apps and payment services. Purpose of the article: In this research, prior findings have been cumulated indicating that mobile social apps extend throughout consumer attitudes and behaviors by the widespread adoption of smartphones. We contribute to the literature by showing that cutting-edge technological developments associated with customer behavior in relation to mobile commerce apps have resulted in the rise of data-driven systems. Consumer behavioral intention and adoption intention in relation to mobile shopping apps/websites are developed on perceived risk and trust consequences. Methods: Throughout February and March 2021, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was carried out, with search terms comprising ""mobile shopping app"", ""mobile commerce platform"", ""mobile payment service"", ""Internet-enabled consumer device"", ""consumer technological adoption"", and ""mobile shopping behavior"". As research published between 2018 and 2021 was analyzed, only 330 sources met the suitability criteria. By removing questionable or indeterminate findings (insubstantial/inconsequent data), results unconfirmed by replication, too imprecise content, or having quite similar titles, 66, chiefly empirical, sources were selected. A systematic review of recently published literature was carried out on technological adoption of mobile commerce apps by employing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The Systematic Review Data Repository was used, a software program for the gathering, handling, and analysis of data for the systematic review. The quality of the academic articles was determined by harnessing the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Findings & value added: The consumer purchase decision-making process in mobile app-based marketing involves consumer engagement and willingness to adopt mobile commerce apps. Further advancements should clarify how technological-based consumer adoption of mobile shopping throughout social commerce can improve the payment for products and services."

P. Carey School of Business,Article,"© 2021 INFORMSBuilding on the distinction between search and experience goods, as well as vertical and horizontal differentiation, we propose a set of theory-grounded, data-driven measures that allow us to measure not only product type (search vs. experience, horizontal vs. vertical differentiation) but also sources of uncertainty and to what extent consumer reviews help resolve uncertainty. The proposed measures have two advantages over prior methods: (1) unlike prior categorization schemes that classified goods as either search or experience goods, our measure is continuous, allowing us to rank-order the degree of search versus experience and horizontal versus vertical differentiation among products or categories. (2) Our approach is easier to implement than prior methods, because it relies solely on consumer ratings information (as opposed to expert judgment) and can be employed at multiple levels (attributes, products, or product categories). We illustrate empirical applications of our proposed measures using product rating data from Amazon.com. Our data-driven measures reveal the relative importance of fit in driving product utility and the importance of search for determining fit for each product category at Amazon. Our results also show that, while ratings based on verified purchasers are informative of objective product values, the current Amazon review system appears to have limited ability to resolve fit uncertainty. Our method and findings could facilitate further research on product review systems and enable quantitative measurement of product positioning to support marketing strategy for retailers and manufacturers, covering an expanded group of products."

In recent years, video games and their potential positive effects on stress relief have been researched and “relaxation” has been an important keyword in marketing a certain kind of video game. In a quasi-experimental design, this study investigated the increase of average daily player peak (ADPPs) for the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and if this increase was significantly larger for relaxing games in contrast to non-relaxing games. Results showed a medium-sized increase of ADPPs over all types of games but no difference between relaxing games and non-relaxing games. These results are discussed in regards to their potential of presenting gaps between the current theoretical models of the influence of video games on mental health and actual observed player behaviour."

A critical challenge in enterprise data science is to enable an effective ‘whole-of-enterprise’ data understanding and data-driven discovery and decision-making on all-round enterprise DNA. Accordingly, here we introduce a neural encoder Table2Vec for automated universal representation learning of entities such as customers from all-round enterprise DNA with automated data characteristics analysis and data quality augmentation. The learned universal representations serve as representative and benchmarkable enterprise data genomes (similar to biological genomes and DNA in organisms) and can be used for enterprise-wide and domain-specific learning tasks. Table2Vec integrates automated universal representation learning on low-quality enterprise data and downstream learning tasks. Such automated universal enterprise representation and learning cannot be addressed by existing enterprise data warehouses (EDWs), business intelligence and corporate analytics systems, where ‘enterprise big tables’ are constructed with reporting and analytics conducted by specific analysts on respective domain subjects and goals. It addresses critical limitations and gaps of existing representation learning, enterprise analytics and cloud analytics, which are analytical subject, task and data-specific, creating analytical silos in an enterprise. We illustrate Table2Vec in characterizing all-round customer data DNA in an enterprise on complex heterogeneous multi-relational big tables to build universal customer vector representations. The learned universal representation of each customer is all-round, representative and benchmarkable to support both enterprise-wide and domain-specific learning goals and tasks in enterprise data science. Table2Vec significantly outperforms the existing shallow, boosting and deep learning methods typically used for enterprise analytics. We further discuss the research opportunities, directions and applications of automated universal enterprise representation and learning and the learned enterprise data DNA for automated, all-purpose, whole-of-enterprise and ethical machine learning and data science."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This study examines the experience of marketing departments to become fully data-driven decision-making organizations. We evaluate an organic approach of departmental sensemaking and an administered approach by which top management increase the influence of analytics skilled employees. Data collection commenced with 15 depth interviews of marketing and analytics professionals in the US and Europe involved in the implementation of big data analytics (BDA) and was followed by a survey data of 298 marketing and analytics middle management professionals at United States based firms. The survey data supports the logic that BDA sensemaking is initiated by top management and is comprised of four primary activities: external knowledge acquisition, improving digitized data quality, big data analytics experimentation and big data analytics information dissemination. Top management drives progress toward data-driven decision-making by facilitating sensemaking and by increasing the influence of BDA skilled employees. This study suggests that while a shift toward enterprise analytics increases the quality of resource available to the marketing department, this approach could stymie the quality of marketing insights gained from BDA. This study presents a model of how to improve the quality of marketing insights and improve data-driven decision-making."

However, it is unclear whether current curriculum approaches to marketing analytics equip students with the skills employers need and prepare them effectively for data-driven marketing roles. This study identifies the knowledge and skills marketing graduates require for analytics practice to bridge the theory-practice gap and increase students’ employability. Our research reveals that a blend of knowledge, soft and technical skills is needed, and that the ability to communicate insights from data to stakeholders is critical. We offer a practice-informed model which demonstrates that conceptual knowledge, technical skills, tools skills and soft skills are required to develop holistic analytics capability for marketing practice. Actionable takeaways for how educators can embed holistic analytics teaching in marketing education are also provided."

We consider the integration of customer lifetime value (CLV) thinking into the category selection problem for targeted coupons. This problem involves two primary considerations: should the coupon be a category-specific one? – and, if so, should short-term or rather long-term objectives govern the choice of category? Our paper is the first to address these questions by analyzing the effects of different customized targeting strategies for category coupons on short-term marketing costs and long-term CLV using an analytical model. We develop these targeting strategies with the help of a data-driven customer segmentation framework based on the dimensions of churn, frequency, and loyalty. Using data from a German hypermarket chain, we identify four refined targeting strategies that enable multi-category retailers to exploit the full potential of customized marketing by optimizing the trade-off between marketing cost and CLV considerations. Our analysis reveals that the targeting strategy most likely to be employed by retail practice – as compared with the one most commonly used – can yield a substantially higher CLV even as it reduces wasteful marketing costs."

The authors explore the single and compounded effect of the motivational salience of food’s intrinsic reinforcing value tied to its sugar content and that of two marketing food cues, price and in-store display, on actual consumer purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above hypotheses in two perceived “healthy” product categories with a wide distribution of sugar content. The authors estimate a within-category model using three years of retail transaction data to test the effect on weekly sales. Findings: The authors confirm the single effect of each of food’s and marketing cues’ motivational salience as well as their compounded effect with high-motivational-salience food being less price elastic and more susceptible to in-store display activities. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the need to complement current reliance on unhealthy/healthy perception with finer grained objective evidence linked to the formulation of the food itself and the marketing applied to them. Practical implications: The present study findings may help marketing managers and policymakers develop better targeted pricing and display strategies for low- and high-motivational-salience food, attempting to strike a better balance between consumer welfare and commercial performance. Originality/value: This paper is one of the few that links real-world market outcomes to predictions derived from a unique combination of consumer neuroscience and neurobiology of food, advancing data-driven decisions."

Engineering Reports published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.A successful business intelligence solution can help organizations improve the quality and speed of their decision-making processes by analyzing the consolidated information collected from their websites. Using the current Web server log standard, which indicates only the locations of served Web pages, may lead to inaccurate business analysis for data driven and frequently updated static content Web pages. A properly defined Web content usage data warehouse that captures both dynamic and static contents of web pages provides rich data source for discovering interesting business rules among users' activities. This paper demonstrates the simplicity of data extract, transform and load procedures to import raw Web content usage log to various data models for data analysis, reporting and data mining tools. In this paper, we use two data mining techniques (expected maximization and the prefixspan algorithms) for visitor grouping and path analysis to find interesting patterns in Web content usage log data, an important component of e-commerce Web sites traffic analysis. Visitor grouping uses data clustering to group visitors/sessions with similar selected attributes' value. Path analysis mines common visiting path sequence. The ultimate goal is to enable the online merchant provide enhanced and differentiated marketing services generally to its existing and potential customers and tell what items customers are interested in instead of ambiguous URLs."

Ensuring cohesion in outcomes across multiple sites is important to the development of a holistic competitive marketing strategy that seeks to promote “brand” performance characterized by a superior quality of patient care. This requires mechanisms for data collection and development of a single uniform outcomes measurement system site wide. Operationalizing a true multidisciplinary effort in this space requires intersection of a vast array of information technology and administrative resources along with the neurosurgeons who provide subject-matter expertise relevant to patient care. To measure neurosurgical quality and safety as well as improve payor contract negotiations, a practice analytics dashboard was created to allow summary visualization of operational indicators such as case volumes, quality outcomes, and relative value units and financial indicators such as total hospital costs and charges in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the “value” of surgical care. The current version of the dashboard summarizes these metrics by site, surgeon, and procedure for nearly 30,000 neurosurgical procedures that have been logged into the Mayo Clinic Enterprise Neurosurgery Registry since transition to the Epic electronic health record (EHR) system.

It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in data driven-marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the “right” customers, to “keep” and “grow” them and to sustain “growth” and “profitability”. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses, 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included retail, BFSI, healthcare and government, automobile, telecommunication, transport and logistics and IT. Other industries represented were aviation, marketing research and consulting, hospitality, advertising and media and human resource. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for DDM. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders and Leaders based on their “current level of investments” and “willingness to enhance investments” soon. Research limitations/implications: With storming digital age and the development of analytics, the process of decision-making has gained significant importance. Judgment and intuition too are critical to the process. Choosing an appropriate action cannot be done strictly on a rational basis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of DDM. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; however, attitudes and social factors are equally important. Originality/value: There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”."

The Smart Tourism Destinations concept arises from the advancement of smart cities. Since information technologies are considered a key competitive element of a city's destination, tourism companies invest extensively in smart system initiatives. Moreover, the smart city concept and related approaches are increasingly recognized by cities worldwide to optimize sustainable environments. Furthermore, a smart tourist city faces the challenge of creating urban areas that residents and tourists can experience together, particularly in cities that pose new tourism challenges. This paper proposes the Data-Driven Sustainable Smart City Framework (DDSSCF) for sustainable green tourism strategies and policies. This paper explores the aspects of technologies essential for creating a smart city and a fashionable tourism destination. The preservation of the climate, protected cultural heritage, and natural resources would contribute to an environment, the economic, social sustainable field of tourism by reducing hazardous pollutants and energy usage. Therefore, based on the preservation limit, it has been classified into three components includes-green architecture, green waste, and green energy as a part of the green management framework at the same time. Hence, green tourism, including marketing efforts, such as green marketing, are necessary for the vision of successful adequate green management activities. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances efficiency ratio when compared to other existing methods."
85126510454,On Robustness of Mutual Funds Categorization and Distance Metric Learning,Desai D.,Journal of Financial Data Science,2021-09-01,10.3905/jfds.2021.3.4.130,5,The Vanguard Group in Malvern,Article,"© 2021 With Intelligence Ltd.Identifying similar mutual funds among a given universe of funds has many applications, including competitor analysis, marketing and sales, tax loss harvesting, and so on. For a contemporary analyst, the most popular approach to finding similar funds is to look up a categorization system such as Morningstar categorization. Morningstar categorization has been heavily investigated by academic researchers from various angles, including using unsupervised clustering techniques in which clusters were found to be inconsistent with categorization. Recently, however, categorization has been studied using supervised classification techniques, with the categories being the target labels. Categorization was indeed learnable with very high accuracy using a purely data-driven approach, causing a paradox: Clustering was inconsistent with respect to categorization, whereas supervised classification was able to reproduce (near) complete categorization. Here, the authors resolve this apparent paradox by pointing out incorrect uses and interpretations of machine learning techniques in the previous academic literature. The authors demonstrate that by using an appropriate list of variables and metrics to identify the optimal number of clusters and preprocessing the data using distance metric learning, one can indeed reproduce the Morningstar categorization using a data-driven approach. The present work puts an end to the debate on this issue and establishes that the Morningstar categorization is indeed intrinsically rigorous, consistent, rule-based, and reproducible using data-driven approaches, if machine learning techniques are correctly implemented."

This research quantitatively evaluates the ability of data-driven personas to alter decision makers’ preconceptions about their online social media users. We conduct a within-participant experiment of 31 professionals carrying out a workplace task scenario. The participants’ conceptions of user attributes are recorded both before and after interacting with personas created from real user analytics data. Using statistical analysis to compare the responses, we find that personas had a significant effect on changing preconceptions about the audience segments. After interacting with personas, 81% of the participants changed their preconceptions of the audience, and 94% of the participants maintained or increased the accuracy of their perceptions of the audience after engaging with the personas. Moreover, the confidence of the participants in their responses increased. However, two participants did not change their preconceptions even when faced with contradictory factual information, which highlights the need for accompanying initiatives to align user preconceptions with user data fully."
85131263835,Development of Personas to Communicate Narrative-Based Information About the HPV Vaccine on Twitter,Massey P.M.,Frontiers in Digital Health,2021-08-04,10.3389/fdgth.2021.682639,7,Drexel University,Article,"© Copyright © 2021 Massey, Chiang, Rose, Murray, Rockett, Togo, Klassen, Manganello and Leader.Introduction: Personas are based on real-life typologies of people that can be used to create characters and messages to communicate important health information through relatable narrative storylines. Persona development is data-driven and can involve multiple phases of formative research and evaluation; however, personas are largely underutilized in digital health research. The purpose of this study was to create and document persona development to deliver narrative-focused health education for parents on Twitter with the goal of increasing uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents. Methods: Leveraging data from a mixed-method study conducted in the U.S. with a diverse population of parents with adolescents ages 9–14, we used both qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., the National Immunization Survey—Teen, focus groups, and social media) to create personas. These data sources were used to identify and develop key characteristics for personas to reflect a range of parents and their diverse understandings and experiences related to HPV vaccination. A parent advisory board provided insight and helped refine persona development. Results: Four personas emerged and were characterized as the (1) Informed Altruist, (2) Real Talker, (3) Information Gatherer, and (4) Supporter. Characteristics differed across personas and provided insights into targeted narrative strategies. Described attributes included demographics, psychographics, communication style, vaccine goals and aspirations, vaccine challenges and frustrations, and vaccine hesitancy. Discussion: This work demonstrates how multiple data sources can be used to create personas to deliver social media messages that can address the diverse preferences and needs of parents for HPV vaccine information. With increasing usage of social media for health information among parents, it is important for researchers to consider marketing and design thinking to create health communication messages that resonate with audiences."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.With airline companies increasingly relying on crowdsourcing websites to deploy their digital marketing strategies, marketeers and strategists seek to acquire an understanding of the factors affecting airlines’ organic traffic and user engagement. Such an understanding is acquired through the consideration of variables that influence a company’s organic traffic and user engagement and their correlation to each other. A three-stage data-driven analysis is used to examine the correlation between the foregoing variables and to consider strategies that can be implemented to optimize organic traffic and user engagement. The first section gathers data from five airline companies’ websites and five crowdsourcing websites over an interval of 180 days. The second stage creates an exploratory diagnostic model, through Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping, to visually illustrate the cause-and-effect correlations between the examined metrics. Finally, a predictive micro-level agent-based model simulates optimization strategies that can be used to improve organic traffic and user engagement. The results of this study, reveal that crowdsourcing organic traffic increases airline websites’ user engagement through paid campaigns, while a limited correlation was found to exist between the average duration of a user to organic traffic. The results of this study provide tangible digital marketing strategies which can be used by airline companies to improve the influence of their digital marketing strategies on their users."
85104788054,Why doesn't our value creation payoff: Unpacking customer analytics-driven value creation capability to sustain competitive advantage,Hossain M.A.,Journal of Business Research,2021-07-01,10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.03.063,46,North South University,Article,"© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Advancing value creation has gained momentum in recent years due to the dramatic growth of data-driven marketing analytics. As such, there is an ever-growing surge both in academia and industry to understand data-driven value creation. In particular, customers' data exhibit a new pathway of value creation by deploying customer analytics. Despite the strategic importance, there is limited attention to develop and examine the customer analytics-driven value creation capability (CAVCC). Drawing on the resource-based view capability, knowledge-based view, and market orientation, this current research develops and validates a hierarchical model on CAVCC in the big data analytics spectrum. The findings identify the direct and indirect impact on sustained competitive advantage in which customer linking plays a mediating role. The paper discusses key theoretical and practical contributions, along with future research directions."
85089033499,How and when do big data investments pay off? The role of marketing affordances and service innovation,De Luca L.M.,Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,2021-07-01,10.1007/s11747-020-00739-x,92,Cardiff Business School,Article,"© 2020, The Author(s).Big data technologies and analytics enable new digital services and are often associated with superior performance. However, firms investing in big data often fail to attain those advantages. To answer the questions of how and when big data pay off, marketing scholars need new theoretical approaches and empirical tools that account for the digitized world. Building on affordance theory, the authors develop a novel, conceptually rigorous, and practice-oriented framework of the impact of big data investments on service innovation and performance. Affordances represent action possibilities, namely what individuals or organizations with certain goals and capabilities can do with a technology. The authors conceptualize and operationalize three important big data marketing affordances: customer behavior pattern spotting, real-time market responsiveness, and data-driven market ambidexterity. The empirical analysis establishes construct validity and offers a preliminary nomological test of direct, indirect, and conditional effects of big data marketing affordances on perceived big data performance."
85108152798,Development of an intelligent data-driven system to recommend personalized fashion design solutions,Sharma S.,Sensors,2021-06-02,10.3390/s21124239,23,Ecole Centrale de Lille,Article,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the context of fashion/textile innovations towards Industry 4.0, a variety of digital technologies, such as 3D garment CAD, have been proposed to automate, optimize design and manufacturing processes in the organizations of involved enterprises and supply chains as well as services such as marketing and sales. However, the current digital solutions rarely deal with key elements used in the fashion industry, including professional knowledge, as well as fashion and functional requirements of the customer and their relations with product technical parameters. Especially, product design plays an essential role in the whole fashion supply chain and should be paid more attention to in the process of digitalization and intelligentization of fashion companies. In this context, we originally developed an interactive fashion and garment design system by systematically integrating a number of data-driven services of garment design recommendation, 3D virtual garment fitting visualization, design knowledge base, and design parameters adjustment. This system enables close interactions between the designer, consumer, and manufacturer around the virtual product corresponding to each design solution. In this way, the complexity of the product design process can drastically be reduced by directly integrating the consumer’s perception and professional designer’s knowledge into the garment computer-aided design (CAD) environment. Furthermore, for a specific consumer profile, the related computations (design solution recommendation and design parameters adjustment) are performed by using a number of intelligent algorithms (BIRCH, adaptive Random Forest algorithms, and association mining) and matching with a formalized design knowledge base. The proposed interactive design system has been implemented and then exposed through the REST API, for designing garments meeting the consumer’s personalized fashion requirements by repeatedly running the cycle of design recommendation—virtual garment fitting—online evaluation of designer and consumer—design parameters adjustment—design knowledge base creation, and updating. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through a business case of personalized men’s shirt design."

To deeply understand the relationships between retail prices and reviews, this paper designs an intelligent data-driven Generate/Test Cycle using a machine learning technique to automatically discover the relationship model from a huge amount of data without a prior hypothesis. From a unique dataset, various free-form relationship models with their own structures and parameters have been discovered. By the comprehensive evaluations of candidate models, a guided map was offered to understand the relationship between dynamic retail prices and the volume/valence of reviews for different types of products. Experimental results show that 37.69% of products in our sample exhibit the following trend: When the price is increased to a certain level, the volume of reviews shifts from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend. Results also demonstrate that a linearly increasing relationship model between prices and the valence of reviews is more suitable for the low-involvement products than for the high-involvement products. In addition to the new findings, this research provides a powerful tool to assist domain experts in building relationship models for decision making in a highly efficient manner."
85097465693,Evaluating and Categorizing Cruise Lines by ship attributes: A Comparison Between Cruisers and Experts,Sun X.,Tourism Management,2021-06-01,10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104262,12,East China Normal University,Article,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdElectronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) is an important information source used by consumers to make travel decisions. However, eWOM from travel experts and everyday travelers can be inconsistent, potentially leading to blurred product evaluations and market positioning. This paper examines this issue in the context of the cruise industry with the goal of identifying differences in the evaluation of cruise brands by cruise experts and consumers, as well as the product factors that influence these judgements. The research used a data-driven empirical approach and secondary data from a leading cruise review site consisting of scaled ratings across 9 ship attributes and 24 brands by more than 150,000 cruisers and 174 experts. Data analysis using the TOPSIS method and regression and multigroup models shows that experts and cruisers evaluate cruise brands differently and are influenced by different ship attributes when forming evaluations. For example, value-add attributes (e.g., service, enrichment activities, fitness/recreation) significantly influence overall evaluations for cruisers, while core attributes (e.g., cabin, dining, entertainment) significantly influence overall evaluations for experts. Discussion of the empirical results highlights these differences in cruiser vs. expert perceptions as revealed online, as well as the need to update traditional cruise industry categorization to optimize brand positioning and better align product-marketing strategies for effective target marketing."
85115222354,Construction and application exploration of 5T smart farm management systems,Wu W.,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,2021-05-01,10.11975/j.issn.1002-6819.2021.09.038,7,Jilin Business and Technology College,Article,"© 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.The smart farm was the backbone direction of the third agricultural revolution led by agricultural digital information technology. By analyzing and comparing the development situation of China's smart farm in recent years, it was found that the development of China's smart farm was still in the exploratory stage, and bold exploration should be carried out from different angles. The smart farm is a systematic project that is gradually intelligent in the process of agricultural production, precise in time, and fine in indicators. It is the deep integration of information technology, management technology, biotechnology, and intelligent agricultural machinery. According to the natural block characteristics of the whole plant growth and continuance, crop production can be divided into five-time channels, namely, seed-stage, seedling stage, paddy shoot stage, grain stage, and product stage, that is the big 5T. The seed-stage time channel includes a seed-stage time block, the seedling stage time channel includes a seedling stage time block, and the paddy shoot stage time channel includes a paddy shoot stage time block. According to the natural block characteristics of the grain growth and continuance, the time channel of grain stage can be divided into five-time blocks, harvest, field, drying, warehousing, and storage, that is the small 5T. The time channel of the product stage includes three-time blocks, processing, marketing, and eating. 5T management aims at 12-factor management for each stage of crop production. The information of 12-factor management includes man, soil, time, seed, machine, number, water, fertilizer, pesticides, temperature, humidity, and moisture. Based on innovating 5T precision time agricultural production management methods and standards, a basic element model of smart farms based on the time channel of crop growth, the time block of continuance, and system architecture of the 5T management system were proposed in this study. The 5T smart farm management system was developed by using the architecture of the 5T smart farm system, which integrated dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) code, IoT, mobile APP, and big data technology. The promotion and application of the 5T smart farm management system in 12 enterprises of the Jilin rice industry alliance had been implemented. According to the ""5T Post-harvest management technique code for high-quality paddy"", the precision nursing operation was further carried out around the grain stage of high-quality paddy according to the principle of staging, classification, timely, low temperature, and moderate. The system integrated the functions of 5T management implementation, product quality traceability, and new technology application. Based on supporting the development of a variety of remote detectors, the system used a mobile APP and the intelligent device remote data sending unit to collect the 5T data, stored the data in a distributed way, and combined online and offline evaluation, to achieve the effect of ""data-driven price"", and realized the dual traceability mechanism of operation quality and product quality. In the analysis of the collected data, it was found that improper management of the paddy harvest period caused a 7.16% hidden loss. The annual output of paddy in Jilin Province was 6.67 million t, the theoretical calculation of paddy loss in the field was 478 000 t. The system was gradually improved and upgraded according to the actual operation situation and had achieved remarkable efficiency, loss reduction, and quality improvement. The fine management and precise decision method of the 5T smart farm management system can closely connect intelligent control with unmanned agricultural machinery equipment, and realize intelligent autonomous unmanned farms."
85066110679,Targeting customers for profit: An ensemble learning framework to support marketing decision-making,Lessmann S.,Information Sciences,2021-05-01,10.1016/j.ins.2019.05.027,39,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin,Article,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.Marketing messages are most effective if they reach the right customers. Deciding which customers to contact is an important task in campaign planning. The paper focuses on empirical targeting models. We argue that common practices to develop such models do not account sufficiently for business goals. To remedy this, we propose profit-conscious ensemble selection, a modeling framework that integrates statistical learning principles and business objectives in the form of campaign profit maximization. Studying the interplay between data-driven learning methods and their business value in real-world application contexts, the paper contributes to the emerging field of profit analytics and provides original insights how to implement profit analytics in marketing. The paper also estimates the degree to which profit-concious modeling adds to the bottom line. The results of a comprehensive empirical study confirm the business value of the proposed ensemble learning framework in that it recommends substantially more profitable target groups than several benchmarks."
85097041616,Multi-objective Grammatical Evolution of Decision Trees for Mobile Marketing user conversion prediction,Pereira P.J.,Expert Systems with Applications,2021-04-15,10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114287,19,Universidade do Minho,Article,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdThe worldwide adoption of mobile devices is raising the value of Mobile Performance Marketing, which is supported by Demand-Side Platforms (DSP) that match mobile users to advertisements. In these markets, monetary compensation only occurs when there is a user conversion. Thus, a key DSP issue is the design of a data-driven model to predict user conversion. To handle this nontrivial task, we propose a novel Multi-objective Optimization (MO) approach to evolve Decision Trees (DT) using a Grammatical Evolution (GE), under two main variants: a pure GE method (MGEDT) and a GE with Lamarckian Evolution (MGEDTL). Both variants evolve variable-length DTs and perform a simultaneous optimization of the predictive performance and model complexity. To handle big data, the GE methods include a training sampling and parallelism evaluation mechanism. The algorithms were applied to a recent database with around 6 million records from a real-world DSP. Using a realistic Rolling Window (RW) validation, the two GE variants were compared with a standard DT algorithm (CART), a Random Forest and a state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) model. Competitive results were obtained by the GE methods, which present affordable training times and very fast predictive response times."

The data pertaining to the BDDCE practices were collected from the decision-makers in three groups, namely, purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics & marketing function from the auto-component manufacturing industry. First, the consensus on the BDDCE practices within the group was ascertained followed by determining the decision weights using the percentage distributions and subjective weights. This was followed by the by computing the dominance degrees on pairwise comparisons of the BDDCE practices and ranking them using the PROMETHEE II method. The findings indicated that the BDDCE practices that were more inclined towards the enhancement of internal supply chain integration were most preferred and highly ranked by the decisionmakers in the auto-component industry as compared to the practices that were focused on improving the supplier and customer interfaces such as green purchasing, sale of excess inventory, and developing recycling systems for end-of-life products and materials. The high ranked BDDCE practices included minimization of the raw material consumption, plan for reuse, recycle, recovery of material, parts, and reduction of the process waste at the design stage."

Advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies make it easier to achieve significant performance in a wide range of domains from city planning and marketing analysis to credit evaluation and identity theft detection. However, it still requires great efforts in selecting efficient learning algorithms and precise model parameters that are deemed confidential in the light of experience. Also worth noting is that there is a fundamental gap between impracticable business requirements and the available value of data reflected. The data holder or data service provider may not have a clear understanding of data interference. The solution to these two problems depends on the capability of predicting the data utility in advance, which raises a fundamental question: to what degree is the data utility predictable? In this work, we present a primary analytical framework for information-theoretic bounds of data utility and utilize the current state-of-the-art and representative algorithms to obtain the achievable lower bounds on a real-world data set. The gap between theoretical upper bounds and achievable lower bounds indicates that the achievable lower bounds can still be optimized for performance."

85086864633,Impact of data-driven online financial consumption on supply chain services,Li L.,Industrial Management and Data Systems,2021-03-29,10.1108/IMDS-01-2020-0025,5,Tianjin University,Article,"© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Employing big data analysis tools, this study examines the significance of supply chain integration affecting online financial consumption, analyzes the online financial consumption demand of mobile phone consumers, promotes the optimization of supply chain services with consumers as the focus and proposes full integration of a mobile phone supply chain in terms of product, logistics and marketing, in order to improve the supply and demand relationship between consumers and suppliers; the overall objective is to promote further development of online financial consumption. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) and cosine similarity text analysis are used for analyzing online demand for mobile phone products, studying the influence of supply chain services on consumption demand and identifying strategies for promoting overall optimization of the supply chain to meet online financial consumption demands of consumers; the study analyzes online reviews on mobile phone topics from the JingDong (JD) platform and Weibo platform. Findings: Research results show that online demand for mobile phone products is greatly influenced by supply chain links such as product design, logistics transportation and marketing promotion. The consumption demand for different mobile phone products has different emphases, but the differences are not significant. The overall improvement of the supply chain should focus on product research and development, logistics layout optimization and marketing promotion, in order to meet and guide the online financial demand of consumers and improve the effectiveness of supply chain management. Research limitations/implications: This study only considered data from China's largest online mobile phone sales platform and Weibo text data owing to the data sensitivity involved. Originality/value: There are few supply chain optimization studies based on online financial consumption reviews from customers. Therefore, this study integrates online consumption trends into a supply chain analysis framework to explore strategies for promoting supply chain optimization according to customer demands, improving the benign interaction of participants in the supply chain and promoting the development of online financial consumption."

A critical lens is turned on the macroscopic economic and micro-social processes of the geospatial industry that result in the hegemonic relations and discursive regimes that legitimize and naturalize a common geospatially equipped, data-driven world. The annual user conventions and platform marketing of Esri, the global market leader in geographical information systems (GIS), acts as a site to observe how an imagined geospatial community of practitioners and investors is constructed. Branded content is unpacked to understand how the company's image-making cultivates power relations between the public at large while negating itself as gatekeeper. These symbolic processes and collective practices help influence the uncritical investment and growth of the geospatial industry."

In big data era, analyzing consumers preferences for e-coupons by their online behavior and the impact of data imbalance caused by low active consumers are rarely studied. Thus, we propose a two-stage hybrid model. Firstly, consumer segmentation is implemented to analyze behavioral characteristics for each segment and distinguish low active consumers, then models are constructed for different consumer segments. The proposed model is applied to a real online consumption data. Consumers are aggregated into four segments: potential e-coupons user, low discount sensitive user, high discount sensitive user (including discount preference and fixed preference). The first one is defined as low active consumer segment and others are high active consumer segments. Isolation forest model and logistic regression model are respectively constructed for them. Result shows that data imbalance is effectively relieved, prediction performance is also significantly better than the traditional approaches. Finally, e-coupons’ usage characteristics for each consumer segment are summarized, according to that, companies can increase sales and improve consumer satisfaction as well."

Responding to Exploitative Business Systems in Person and Online,Paterson J.M.,Journal of Consumer Policy,2021-03-01,10.1007/s10603-020-09467-9,3,Melbourne Law School,Article,"© 2020, The Author(s).Australian consumer protection law contains broad and flexible prohibitions on misleading and unconscionable conduct in trade or commerce. Yet concerns have been raised that these prohibitions are unsuitable for responding to predatory business systems. These are businesses that, by design or operation, target consumers experiencing vulnerability to offer costly products ill-suited to their needs. This concern has arisen in response to prominent instances of products of dubious efficacy offered to marginalized communities. It has also arisen from concerns over the increasing potential for data-driven digital marketing to manipulate consumer choice by targeting with fine-grained accuracy consumer vulnerabilities. In response to these concerns, it has been suggested that the Australian Consumer Law should be reformed, by introducing a prohibition on “unfair trading” inspired by the general prohibitions on such conduct in the EU and USA. This paper explores the key considerations relevant in assessing the merits of this proposed statutory “transplant.” Ultimately, the paper is supportive of the proposed reform, while also recognizing its limits."

Design/methodology/approach: The present research uses survival analysis (SA) and the Cox proportional-hazards regression (CPHR) to analyze condo sales data provided by the REALTORS® Association of Edmonton (RAE) (Alberta, Canada). Findings: The analysis of the provided data shows that the listed price, building age, appliances and condo fees have less effect on the time a condo spends on the market compared to the condo’s physical features, such as construction material, interior finishing and heating type and source. Research limitations/implications: The data used in the present research comes from one geographical area (i.e. Edmonton, Canada). Furthermore, the data provided by the RAE does not include any real estate transactions not involving a realtor. Additionally, the present research, owing to its focus on design-related features, does not control features related to the external environment, such as community and transportation proximity. Practical implications: The findings of the present research help construction practitioners (e.g. architects, builders and realtors) better understand the features that influence condo buyers’ decisions. This knowledge helps to develop designs and marketing strategies that increase the likelihood of selling and decrease the time listed condos spend on the market. Originality/value: The present research expands our knowledge of the drivers influencing the purchasers’ decisions concerning the building’s physical features that can be controlled during the design stage. Also, analyzing the provided data by using SA and CPHR, as followed in this paper, facilitates the inclusion of records that are listed but not sold, which helps to overcome the survivorship bias and avoid the over-optimism that exists in the present literature."

It can replace multiple regression, path analysis, factor analysis, covariance analysis and other methods to clearly analyze the effect of individual indicators on the overall and the relationship between individual indicators. SEM is a multivariate statistical modeling technology mainly applied to confirmatory factor analysis model. Due to the advantages of measuring latent variable scores through observable variables and analyzing the synergistic effects between latent variables using different sub-models, SEM is widely used in data modeling and analysis in the fields of psychology, behavior, and marketing. It provides a mature application path of proposing the concept-designing the model-obtaining data -verifying the model. Geoscience data modeling technology has always been one of the hotspots in geoscience research, the purpose of which is to extract valuable model structures and latent variables from massive, multi-dimensional, high-dimensional, and multi-temporal geo-data, and to study different geovariables and interactive relationship between latent variables so as to support related applications and research such as environmental governance, disaster prevention, resource prospecting, and ecological evaluation. With the changes in the scale of geoscience data and the continuous development of modeling tools, the geoscience data modeling have gradually changed from sampling to full-sample, the method from under the guidance of geological models to unconstrained / weak-constrained modeling, the basis from variable causality to variable correlation, and the complexity from single model / single process to comprehensive multi-model / multi-process. SEM is a comprehensive modeling method, which can include multiple analysis techniques such as factor analysis, latent variable estimation, path analysis, etc. This multi-level, multi-branch modeling method combines the characteristics of knowledge-driven modeling and data-driven modeling. SEM generally faces the following three challenges, also three changes, in the modeling of geoscience data: from a method mainly oriented to confirmatory modeling and analysis to an exploratory modeling and analysis method; from a construction with complete geological model constraints to a weak model / unconstrained geological data modeling method; from a modeling of statistical variables without spatial attributes to a modeling of spatial statistical variables. This puts forward new requirements on the model itself and the method of data modeling. In response to the above three issues, this article reviews the concept and development of SEM, and introduces three application cases of SEM in geological data modeling. One is using lake sediment geochemical data to extract mineralization endogenous factors in gold mines which is modeled under weak constraints. The second is using the comprehensive parameter optimization method of SEM to weaken and correct CI problem of weight of evidence in the calculation of the posterior probability of gold prospecting by matching the posterior probability and the observation posterior probability. The third is using SEM to study the forest protection strategy of the Magdalena watershed in Mexico. By numbering the forest blocks in different regions, the spatial distribution of the data is transformed into traditional statistical variables without spatial attributes, and the impact of different environmental strategies on forest protection is analyzed."

It is based on a survey that examines the benefits they see social media as having before, during, and after a trip to a destination, using their responses to generate a data-driven segmentation. Data from a total of 218 questionnaires were analyzed using factor and cluster analysis in sequence, specifically applying a hierarchical cluster analysis using the Ward method and a Kmeans algorithm. The analysis led to the identification of four useful types of social media user: info-seeker, communication-seeker, interaction-seeker, and hybrid segments, each of which seeks different things from social media and use it in different ways (e.g., to seek information, to see what other people have said about a destination, or to post their own experiences). As such, the implications of our findings offer useful insights for both scholars and destination marketers, highlighting the significance of offering appropriate marketing strategies for each type of segment."

In the last five years, new technologies have disrupted this space and supported the exponential growth of digital advertising. Creative content may be distributed via internet-connected devices, such as desktop, mobile, or connected TV. Advertisers must understand the benefits and risks of each channel to best allocate their marketing budgets and drive both growth and cost savings. Tech and data-driven digital advertising promises many benefits to advertisers, ranging from precision targeting and measurable results to automation and real-time optimization. At the same time, advertisers face major challenges from a host of actors in the media ecosystem that often have misaligned incentives. Several studies have investigated how digital advertising activities affect business results in order to understand their positive and negative impacts. Very few studies, however, have focused on risk management in relation to digital advertising. In this article, we aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we identify the main risks in the paid distribution of digital advertising and the corresponding mitigation strategies. We examined digital advertising from the advertisers’ media management perspective. Interestingly, we found that risks and corresponding mitigation strategies can be clustered in specific groups that can help chief marketing officers and media executives drive the right actions."

All rights reserved.Haitian agricultural potential is largely unexploited. The country needs a new approach to its agricultural development and development cooperation needs new practices to drive more appropriate interventions. Our research integrates advanced statistical methodologies and SWOT analysis at a pilot scale to identify the most relevant features for farm economic sustainability in the Torbeck Plain. Multidimensional data were collected in 49 farms and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to discover the main components affecting the system’s variability. The most meaningful variables are then used for Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) to provide farms’ classification. Results were used to inform a statistically driven SWOT analysis. PCA reveals the presence of three main components. First, it seems that crop choice makes the difference because of the sale price’s great importance. The irrigation system’s availability affects neither yield nor income, whilst mechanization is mostly important for farms whose farmer’s first crop choice is maize. Moreover, mechanization is a generally worthwhile investment for farms whose fields’ area is at least about 1.2-1.5 ha. Overall, the statistical analysis provides reasonable farms’ classification and interesting insights about the Torbeck agricultural system. These were valuable for informing a SWOT analysis suggesting data-driven strategies for improving the agricultural system in Torbeck, which match the existing international guidelines and provide local priorities for intervention. In the short term they include i) informing crop choice ii) providing opportunities and infrastructure for local marketing. Long-term goals include developing extension services based on subsistence farmers' needs, advocating for data-driven national and international strategies for intervention, deepening the knowledge about relevant threats such as the diffused use of dangerous pesticides, or the unadvised water management."

This study established and segmented post-COVID-19 pandemic tourists based on three psychographic factors of perceived risk. Data were generated from a self-administered online survey of 323 respondents. Exploratory factor analysis identified a triad of perceived risk factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical cluster analysis supported a three cluster solution to comprise dogmatic, sceptical and apprehensive tourists, respectively. The findings show that there are discernable and statistically significant differences across the tourist typologies concerning the influence of media profile on tourist decision-making, the perceived safety of travel and tourism activities, and tourists’ behaviour (travel intentions) after the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, implying that psychographic profiling will be critical in market segmentation and tourists’ targeting with post-crisis communication and marketing promotion in line with their predilections. As a primer to future COVID-19-related behavioural studies, this explorative research contributes critical data driven behavioural insights to enhance the extent of the tourism literature and support tourism practitioners’ tourism marketing decision-making."
85106342824,Big data-driven strategic orientation in international marketing,Akter S.,International Marketing Review,2021-01-01,10.1108/IMR-11-2020-0256,34,University of Wollongong,Article,"© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Big data is one of the most demanding topics in contemporary marketing research. Despite its importance, the big data-based strategic orientation in international marketing is yet to be formed conceptually. Thus, the purpose of this study is to systematically review and propose a holistic framework on big data-based strategic orientation for firms in international markets to attain a sustained firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a systematic literature review to synthesize research rigorously. Initially, 2,242 articles were identified from the selective databases, and 45 papers were finally reported as most relevant to propose an integrative conceptual framework. Findings: The findings of the systematic literature review revealed data-evolving, and data-driven strategic orientations are essential for performing international marketing activities that contain three primary orientations such as (1) international digital platform orientation, (2) international market orientation and (3) international innovation and entrepreneurial orientation. Eleven distinct sub-dimensions reflect these three primary orientations. These strategic orientations of international firms may lead to advanced analytics orientation to attain sustained firm performance by generating and capturing value from the marketplace. Research limitations/implications: The study minimizes the literature gap by forming knowledge on big data-based strategic orientation and framing a multidimensional framework for guiding managers in the context of strategic orientation for international business and international marketing activities. The current study was conducted by following only a systematic literature review exclusively in firms' overall big data-based strategic orientation concept in international marketing. Future research may extend the domain by introducing firms' category wise systematic literature review. Originality/value: The study has proposed a holistic conceptual framework for big data-driven strategic orientation in international marketing literature through a systematic review for the first time. It has also illuminated a future research agenda that raises questions for the scholars to develop or extend theory in this area or other related disciplines."

Specifically, the study proposes a framework of the potential benefits and risks of the online behavioral and data-driven digital advertising (OBA), which can help researchers and practitioners to better understand shopping behavior in the online retailing setting. In addition, the research focuses on the role of privacy concerns in affecting avoidance or adoption of OBA. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach with partial least square (PLS) regression method to test the research hypotheses through data coming from a structured questionnaire. Findings: OBA is a controversial type of advertising that activates opposing reactions on consumers' perspective. Specifically, acceptance of the OBA is positively related to relevance, usefulness and credibility of the personalized advertisements, while the intention to avoid personalized ads is strictly related to the privacy concerns. Consequently, OBA acceptance and avoidance affected the click intention on the ad and the behavioral intention that are decisive for the success of data-driven digital advertising. Originality/value: Prior research came up with complex theoretical frameworks that explain antecedents of OBA focusing only on ethical issues in marketing, on the effectiveness of a single OBA campaign or on how to create a successful advertising campaign. However, no study focuses on the intended or actual behavior of shoppers. Specifically, filling the gap in the existing literature, our research applies an SEM approach to identify both benefits and risks and the antecedents of the actual behavior of individuals in terms of actual purchases promoted by OBA."

The purpose of this paper is to subject the four widely used strategies of revenue management in the hotel industry into an empirical analysis for their suitability at the time of crisis. The data driven approach to modelling has been adopted in this research based on the real-life data obtained from the property management system of nine of the 5-star hotels in Qatar. The results indicate that four of these hypotheses are supported. This revelation has been the basis for drawing implications to the finance and marketing managers of hotels to enhance customer satisfaction and maximise hotel revenue during the COVID-19 or any such pandemic. The results are based on real-life data and have the foundation of well-established pricing strategies in use at the hotels.

While retail analytics plays an increasingly important role in successful retailing management, comprehensive store segmentation based on Data Mining-based Retail Analytics is still an under-researched area. This study seeks to address this gap by developing a novel approach to segment the stores of retail chains based on ‘purchasing behavior of customers’ and applying it in a case study. The applicability and benefits of using Data Mining techniques to examine purchasing behavior and identify store segments are demonstrated in a case study of a global retail chain in Istanbul, Turkey. Over 600 K transaction data of a global grocery retailer are analyzed and 175 stores in Istanbul are successfully segmented into five segments. The results suggest that the proposed new retail analytics approach enables the retail chain to identify clusters of stores in different regions using all transaction data and advances our understanding of store segmentation at the store level. The proposed approach will provide the retail chain the opportunity to manage store clusters by making data-driven decisions in marketing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, inventory management and demand forecasting."

In-depth, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders from eight organic farms, this being deemed a point of data saturation. Our findings reveal that the central concern of participants is how best to negotiate connection with relevant overseas markets. Ten contributing factors are identified here including: negotiating foreign organic certification, understanding consumer perceptions of the term ‘organic’ in each foreign market, and leveraging social media to connect with consumers. Contrary to Porter’s work, state apathy towards the local organic wine sector is identified as one of the factors most detrimental to global competitiveness. This study consequently recommends cooperation between certification bodies, teamwork and knowledge sharing between local organic wine farms, and government involvement in the industry – all this in an effort to create employment, benefit the environment, and increase trade. In search of means of explaining the global competitiveness of a small emerging market, our findings do not fit with Porter’s ‘diamond model’. An alternate data-driven model of explanation is presented in its place."

Alcohol marketers have proven to be innovative experimenters with the participatory and data processing power of these platforms. The aim of this article is (a) to scope how digital advertising and media are typically understood and operationalized in the public health literature and (b) to develop a conceptual framework for investigating alcohol marketing on platforms by identifying new and specific platform affordances that should inform further research in this area. Method: This article is a conceptual review drawing on research on digital alcohol marketing in the public health literature, conceptualizations of digital platforms in media and communication literature, and instructive examples from industry sources. Results: The article identifies five key challenges alcohol marketing on digital platforms poses to regulatory and self-regulatory frameworks, which so far have not been sufficiently considered in the public health literature. Conclusions: The review suggests that in addition to assessing the content, volume, and placement of alcohol advertising, research and regulatory responses need to address alcohol marketing on digital platforms as a dynamic, participatory, and data-driven process."

Previous studies analyzing negative online reviews to conduct dual service failure monitoring from a managerial perspective are scarce. Numerous negative online reviews are useful sources for dual service failure monitoring because they can be easily collected at a low cost. This article proposes a data-driven approach to monitor service failure trends and consecutive service failures from negative online reviews. In the proposed approach, first a classifier is developed to categorize newly collected negative reviews into service failures by Latent Dirichlet allocation. Subsequently, a threshold value is provided to identify a new type of service failure, which was not achieved previously using a control chart. Finally, the probability of consecutive service failures is obtained by association rule mining. A case study of Uber is conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results exhibit that the proposed approach can perform dual service failure monitoring. This study can increase marketing intelligence for dynamic management of service failure and allow rapid responses to service failures."

All rights reserved.Recently, data-driven sales management is widely recognized and sales at the real super-market is not the exception. For designing such strategies, first of all, we have to analyze consumers’ behavior. However, such an analysis is difficult, especially for the managers of the real shops, since they only have customers’ data of their own shops. Generally, the customers buy things not only from the managers’ shops but also other shops. The goal of this research is to develop a general method to transfer sales promotion strategy, derived from analysis on wide area, to local real shop. The authors analyzed such consumers’ characteristics who buy olive oils in Kansai region. For the analysis, we used QPR(Quick Purchase Report system, developed and managed by MACROMILL, Inc). Firstly, we divided the consumers on the QPR into five clusters, according to the simultaneous buying pattern. Then, we analyzed each of the clusters and found some emerging patterns of the purchasing behavior. Observing the patterns, we designed a marketing strategy for the real shop in Hyogo prefecture belonging Kansai district. Finally, we carried out an experiment at the shop to evaluate whether the strategy promotes the sales of the olive oil or not for six weeks. The result of the experiment showed that the marketing strategy is effective in one view. At the same time, we learned many lessons from the research, especially difficulty of the evaluation at the real shop."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper undertakes a data-driven segmentation analysis on tourists’ choice of island destinations in the context of a changing climate. To this end, 2528 tourists visiting ten European islands in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Atlantic regions were posed hypothetical situations in which diverse impacts caused by CC (i.e., beach loss, heatwaves, storm intensification, etc.) were affecting the islands being visited. In each scenario, tourists’ responses ranged from stay on the island to change to an alternative destination. Cluster analysis allowed the identification of four segments: (1) LO-loyal oriented—tourists willing to stay on the island despite any climatic event (in this group, tourists would often change the travel date); (2) RA-risk-averse—tourists who would always avoid islands affected by CC; (3) WIL-risk-specific—a segment of tourists with a special aversion to the risks associated with wildlife disappearance and damage to infrastructure, and (4) 3S-sun, sea and sand seekers—tourists who would always avoid visiting islands where CC induced effects are related to beach loss or extreme events. Further analysis is dedicated to comparing segments in regard to their sociodemographic characteristics, the image of the island, and the importance given to the protection of environmental attributes when choosing an island destination. The results alert us about the climate-specific risks and tourist profiles that are relevant to explaining changes in the tourism geography and seasonality of islands. The findings are useful for providing operational marketing recommendations for destination managers, especially for taking competitive advantage of climate services, and for prevention and responsiveness management strategies."

In the age of digital marketing and big data, marketers are inundated with increasingly rich data from an ever-expanding array of sources. Such data may help marketers generate insights about customers and competitors. One fundamental question remains: How can marketers wrestle massive flows of existing and nascent data resources into coherent, effective growth strategies? Against such a backdrop, the Marketing Science Institute has made “capturing information to fuel growth” a top research priority. The authors begin by discussing the streetlight effect—an overreliance on readily available data due to ease of measurement and application—as contributing to the disconnect between marketing data growth and firm growth. They then use the customer equity framework to structure the discussion of six areas where they see substantial undertapped opportunities: incorporating social network and biometric data in customer acquisition, trend and competitive interaction data in customer development, and unstructured and causal data in customer retention. The authors highlight challenges that obstruct firms from realizing such data-driven growth opportunities and how future research may help overcome those challenges."

One key element of our modeling work is that the GVW model contains two useful indexes representing advertiser's elasticity and the word-of-mouth (WoM) effect, respectively. Moreover, we discuss some desirable properties of the GVW model, and present a deep neural network-based estimation method to learn its parameters. Furthermore, based on three realworld datasets, we conduct computational experiments to validate the GVW model and identified properties. In addition, we also discuss potential advantages of the GVW model over econometric models. The research outcome shows that both the ad elasticity index and the WoM index have significant influences on advertising responses, and the GVW model has potential advantages over econometric models of advertising, in terms of several interesting phenomena drawn from practical advertising situations.

Collecting and storing information on actual and potential voters, volunteers, and donors has produced extensive databases that are then used to guide microtargeting efforts related to advertising, organizing, and fundraising efforts. But building, maintaining, and analyzing this data are costly in itself. This paper looks at two aspects of data-driven political fundraising: precision and selectiveness, with respect to the alignment of the ideology of potential donors and the ideology of the candidate. Specifically, the proposed model is used to determine the optimal precision in estimating a donor’s location on the political ideology spectrum and the optimal targeting decision for fundraising solicitations given that estimate. Analysis of the model produces guidance for changes in solicitation cost and donation size. The results produced by the model are considered in light of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The analysis suggests that the Clinton campaign’s larger donation size likely played a greater role than did the campaign’s higher solicitation cost in terms of targeting. The model is also consistent with the Clinton campaign’s higher expenditures on analytics, given their larger donation size and solicitation cost."

Data science has influenced all business functions in an insurance organization to provide a distinct competitive advantage and push the industry towards the vision of ‘Insure Tech’. This case revolves around one such application of analytics in HDFC analytics dealing with championing the initiative for forecasting and analysis of Business Persistency. The persistency ratio is actually a fairly simple, yet very important metric that provides a snapshot of the health of the insurance industry. Considering the importance of this parameter, it became extremely important for HDFC Life to understand the factors behind persistency numbers and what lies ahead for the organization. The existing forecasting techniques were biased by the nature of work and did not give a significantly accurate and realistic number. The top management found this to be challenging for decision-making and decided that this required the intervention of the Business Insights department. Mr. Francis Rodrigues, SVP—Data Labs, Business Insights and Innovation was given the task to take over the pilot project and increase usage of analytical tools for Persistency Analysis. While Quarter 1 results have been significant, Mr. Francis Rodrigues still wonders whether he captured all the internal and external measures to obtain effective results. Has he done enough and how many more areas can analytics be applied for in the insurance domain? Research Question/Purpose: The current methods of persistency calculation are biased by the nature of work and deflect by a huge margin from the numbers actually achieved. There are no realistic forecasts for the coming year making the management uncertain with the decisions they take for strategic purposes. Theory: Time-indexed collection data help in predicting persistency numbers which are also influenced by some important variables behind collection follow-up and categories of customers. Type of the Case: Applied problem solving. Protagonist: Not needed. Options: Due to the availability of time-indexed data, time series was considered to be the best approach to forecast values into the future. However, that would only solve one half of the problem. It was also important to understand the parameters affecting persistency numbers, important variables behind persistency collections and classify the customers based on such variables. With this knowledge, classification models were also taken into consideration. Discussions and Case Questions: Besides time-indexed collection data which other variables amongst policy and demographic parameters influence persistency parameters? How can insights be drawn about the factors that are actually affecting the persistency numbers? Will calculating and sharing monthly persistency numbers for the coming year improve the percentage of customers remitting payment on time? By classifying customers into various categories with regards to the frequency of follow-up required for premium collection can a favourable segment be carved out?"

Recently, machine learning techniques have also been employed to learn physics, but one of the formidable challenges is to predict complex dynamics, particularly chaos. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of quasi-recurrent neural networks in predicting extremely chaotic behavior in multistable origami structures. While machine learning is often viewed as a “black box”, we conduct hidden layer analysis to understand how the neural network can process not only periodic, but also chaotic data in an accurate manner. Our approach shows its effectiveness in characterizing and predicting chaotic dynamics in a noisy environment of vibrations without relying on a mathematical model of origami systems. Therefore, our method is fully data-driven and has the potential to be used for complex scenarios, such as the nonlinear dynamics of thin-walled structures and biological membrane systems."

The data-driven, personal data extraction and behavioural design practices of 21st century media advertising in digital technology systems mean that food marketing now sits at the intersection of multiple harms, infringing not only children's rights to health and to food, but also their rights to privacy and to be free from exploitation. This further sharpens the need for State regulation to protect children and their rights effectively."
85083328787,The effectiveness of employee retention through an uplift modeling approach,Rombaut E.,International Journal of Manpower,2020-11-28,10.1108/IJM-04-2019-0184,26,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Article,"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The main goal of employee retention is to prevent competent employees from leaving the company. When analysing the main reasons why employees leave and determining their turnover probability, the question arises: Which retention strategies have an actual effect on turnover and for which profile of employees do these strategies work? Design/methodology/approach: To determine the effectiveness of different retention strategies, an overview is given of retention strategies that can be found in the literature. Next, the paper presents a procedure to build an uplift model for testing the effectiveness of the different strategies on HR data. The uplift model is based on random forest estimation and applies personal treatment learning estimation. Findings: Through a data-driven approach, the actual effect of retention strategies on employee turnover is investigated. The retention strategies compensation and recognition are found to have a positive average treatment effect on the entire population, while training and flexibility do not. However, with personalised treatment learning, the treatment effect on the individual level can be estimated. This results in an ability to profile employees with the highest estimated treatment effect. Practical implications: The results yield useful information for human resources practitioners. The personalised treatment analysis results in detailed retention information for these practitioners, which allows them to target the right employees with the right strategies. Originality/value: Even though the uplift modelling approach is becoming increasingly popular within marketing, this approach has not been taken within human resources analytics. This research opens the door for further research and for practical implementation."

Although many service firms apprehend the return from MkIS, others clearly struggle. It seems that MkIS management capability dynamics and their direct/indirect holistic influence on service firm's competitive performance (SFCP) are unsolved in the current data-driven service economy. This study aims to conceptualize a model and test the antecedents on service firms' competitive performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilizes a survey of a sizeable sample of service firms’ managers at the firm level. A total of 250 useable responses were obtained and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings: Results reveal that variables under their respective direct influences are positively and significantly related. Interestingly, MkISMC has a relatively large magnitude of positive and direct effects on service firms' competitive performance. The other variables, such as the use of marketing analytics (UMAN), service innovation and management (SINM), partially mediate the effect of MkISMC on the competitive performance of service firms. Practical implications: The findings inform practitioners that MkISMC, UMAN and SINM play a vital role in attaining service firms' competitive performance in the data-rich environment. Overall, it deepens the understanding of the mediation effect of UMAN and SINM of service firms on competitive performance. Originality/value: The study advances theoretical understanding of resource-based view (RBV), market orientation and dynamic capability that formulate the relationship of MkISMC, UMAN and SINM in attaining SFCP in the ever-changing data-driven business economy."
85096169795,Linking big data analytical intelligence to customer relationship management performance,Zhang C.,Industrial Marketing Management,2020-11-01,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.10.012,55,Tianjin University of Finance and Economics,Article,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.This study investigates the driving forces of a firm's assimilation of big data analytical intelligence (BDAI) and how the assimilation of BDAI improve customer relationship management (CRM) performance. Drawing on the resource-based view, this study argues that a firm's data-driven culture and the competitive pressure it faces in the industry motivate a firm's assimilation of BDAI. As a firm resource, BDAI enables an organization to develop superior mass-customization capability, which in turn positively influences its CRM performance. In addition, this study proposes that a firm's marketing capability can moderate the impact of BDAI assimilation on its mass-customization capability. Using survey data collected from 147 business-to-business companies, this study finds support for most of the hypotheses. The findings of this study uncover compelling insights about the dynamics involved in the process of using BDAI to improve CRM performance."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital marketing is a profitable business generating annual revenue over USD 200B and an inter-annual growth over 20%. The definition of efficient marketing investment strategies across different types of channels and campaigns is a key task in digital marketing. Attribution models are an instrument used to assess the return of investment of different channels and campaigns so that they can assist in the decision-making process. A new generation of more powerful data-driven attribution models has irrupted in the market in the last years. Unfortunately, its adoption is slower than expected. One of the main reasons is that the industry lacks a proper understanding of these models and how to configure them. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present an empirical study to better understand the key properties of user-paths and their impact on attribution models. Our analysis is based on a large-scale dataset including more than 95M user-paths from real advertising campaigns of an international hoteling group. The main contribution of the paper is a set of recommendation to build accurate, interpretable and computationally efficient attribution models such as: (i) the use of linear regression, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to build accurate attribution models; (ii) user-paths including around 12 events are enough to produce accurate models; (iii) the recency of events considered in the user-paths is important for the accuracy of the model."

In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference. The strong empirical evidence indicates that the big e-commerce consumer data facilitates more specialized market psychographic segmentation, which advances data-driven marketing decision-making."

Bringing together partner agencies, advocates and health organizations, the workgroup faced a challenge: there wasn't consensus around focusing on e-cigarettes. There was concern that if too much emphasis was placed on addressing this emerging product, it would be at the cost of reducing combustible use. Youth smoking rates were declining while adult smoking prevalence in Vermont remained stagnant and difficult to move downward. Through applying the lens of best practice and examining the data, the workgroup determined that an ambitious state plan was necessary. Adopting a set of principles grounded in public health and performance measurement, the plan's five goals are to reduce use of all tobacco products among youth and adults. The state plan established a vision of a Vermont free of tobacco use for the program and partners to use, emphasizing data-driven interventions and advancing policymaking, including addressing flavored tobacco products. The tobacco control and regulatory framework in Vermont has worked consistently at the state and local level on strategies involving youth engagement, coalition prevention activities, counter marketing and enforcement. Vermont's framework has evolved to recognize that no matter where a Vermonter is living or working, the protections and services provided by a tobacco program should be equitable. Future application of the public health framework includes exploring innovative policy approaches to curtail the vaping epidemic."
85082841159,Better targeting of consumers: Modeling multifactorial gender and biological sex from Instagram posts,Jeon Y.,User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction,2020-11-01,10.1007/s11257-020-09260-w,8,Ajou University,Article,"© 2020, Springer Nature B.V.Along with the rapidly increasing influence and importance of advertisements and publicity in social networking services (SNS), considerable efforts are being made to provide user-customized services through an understanding of SNS content. Studies on online purchasing patterns based on user attributes have also been conducted; however, these studies used either only experimental methods (e.g., surveys or ethnographic accounts) or simple user attributes (e.g., age, biological sex, and location) for computational user modeling. This paper, through interviews with professional marketers, identifies their needs to understand multifactorial SNS user (potential customers) attributes—gender (i.e., masculine, feminine, androgynous) and biological sex (i.e., male and female) characteristics—for marketing purposes. Based on 33,752 Instagram posts, we develop a deep learning-based, classification model merged with three modalities—image (i.e., VGG16 feature and gesture), text (i.e., linguistic, tag, sentence, and category), and activity (i.e., reply and day). Our model achieves a better performance in classifying three gender types in the male, female, and male + female cases than the traditional machine learning models. Our study results reveal the applicability of identifying gender characteristics from posts in the marketing field."

Carey School of Business,Article,"© 2020 University of Minnesota. All rights reserved.This research methods article proposes a visual data analytics framework to enhance social media research using deep learning models. Drawing on the literature of information systems and marketing, complemented with data-driven methods, we propose a number of visual and textual content features including complexity, similarity, and consistency measures that can play important roles in the persuasiveness of social media content. We then employ state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as deep learning and text mining to operationalize these new content features in a scalable and systematic manner. For the newly developed features, we validate them against human coders on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies with a large social media dataset from Tumblr to show the effectiveness of the proposed content features. The first case study demonstrates that both theoretically motivated and data-driven features significantly improve the model's power to predict the popularity of a post, and the second one highlights the relationships between content features and consumer evaluations of the corresponding posts. The proposed research framework illustrates how deep learning methods can enhance the analysis of unstructured visual and textual data for social media research."

The automatic synthesis of advertising images is challenging because the advertising message must be clearly conveyed while complying with the style required for the product, brand, or target audience. In this study, we proposed a data-driven method to capture individual design attributes and the relationships between elements in advertising images with the aim of automatically synthesizing the input of elements into an advertising image according to a specified style. To achieve this multi-format advertisement design, we created a dataset containing 13 280 advertising images with rich annotations that encompassed the outlines and colors of the elements, in addition to the classes and goals of the advertisements. Using our probabilistic models, users guided the style of synthesized advertisements via additional constraints (e.g., context-based keywords). We applied our method to a variety of design tasks, and the results were evaluated in several perceptual studies, which showed that our method improved users’ satisfaction by 7.1% compared to designs generated by nonprofessional students, and that more users preferred the coloring results of our designs to those generated by the color harmony model and Colormind."

Cleansing, processing and analyzing of such large datasets create challenges for marketing organizations — particularly for real-time decision making and comparative implications. Importantly, there is limited research for such interplays. By utilizing a problematization approach, this paper contributes through the exploration of links between big data, programmatic marketing and real-time processing and relevant decision making for B2B industrial marketing organizations that depend on big data-driven marketing or big data-savvy managers. This exploration subsequently encompasses appropriate big data sources and effective batch and real-time processing linked with structured and unstructured datasets that influence relative processing techniques. Consequently, along with directions for future research, the paper develops interdisciplinary dialogues that overlay computer-engineering frameworks such as Apache Storm and Hadoop within B2B marketing viewpoints and their implications for contemporary marketing practices."

85067023788,A big data driven framework for demand-driven forecasting with effects of marketing-mix variables,Kumar A.,Industrial Marketing Management,2020-10-01,10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.05.003,79,Harvard Business School,Article,"© 2019 Elsevier Inc.This study aims to investigate the contributions of promotional marketing activities, historical demand and other factors to predict, and develop a big data-driven fuzzy classifier-based framework, also called “demand-driven forecasting,” that can shape, sense and respond to real customer demands. The availability of timely information about future customer needs is a key success factor for any business. For profit maximization, manufacturers want to sense demand signals and shape future demands using price, sales, promotion and others economic factors so that they can fulfil customer's orders immediately. However, most demand forecasting systems offer limited insight to manufacturers as they fail to capture contemporary market trends, product seasonality and the impact of forecasting on the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of demand forecasts. In order to achieve this, a back-propagation neural network-based model is trained by fuzzy inputs and compared with benchmark forecasting methods on a time series data, by using historical demand and sales data in combination with advertising effectiveness, expenditure, promotions, and marketing events data. A statistical analysis is conducted, and the experiments show that the method used in the proposed framework outperforms in optimality, efficiency and other statistical metrics. Finally, some invaluable insights for managers are presented to improve the forecast accuracy of fuzzy neural networks, develop marketing plans for products and discuss their implications in several fields."

Consumer preference analysis explains what aspects of a product affect and how they affect a consumer's purchasing decision. This issue plays an important role in e-commerce platforms from its relevance in marketing decisions such as advertisements, recommendations and promotions. In this regard, we propose a data-driven multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) approach to integrate online information, such as explicit (e.g., reviews and ratings) and implicit (e.g., clicks and purchases) feedback from consumers. However, MCDA approaches present a critical challenge that even an experienced product manager could find it difficult to pre-define the criteria on which a product is evaluated. To address this issue, our proposed approach first utilizes text-mining techniques to assist the product manager identify the criteria, and then determines and collects the relative importance of the criteria and their values. Given the criteria information, we use a sampling process to provide two indices, the consumer preference index and rank acceptability index. The first index helps in prioritizing the pairwise comparisons of products, while the second one helps in deriving a default ranking list for first-time-registered consumers. We record the products viewed by consumers and generate their preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons for analyses within an aggregation-disaggregation paradigm. We also provide a representative value function to help the product manager gain insight into the preferences. Finally, we describe how a real-world application including the product manager and consumers exploits the proposed approach on an e-commerce platform to take a large step toward aiding more realistic and data-driven multiple criteria decision making."

While consumer-driven factors have attracted much attention, little research has examined the impact of data-driven mobile advertising alerts on consumer continuance intention for branded mobile apps. This paper analyses the combined influence of consumer beliefs, data-driven mobile advertising alerts, and perceived value on mobile advertising acceptance, intention to repurchase, and recommendation behaviour towards branded mobile apps on social media. In total, 340 valid responses from Spanish customers of an online fashion outlet, all social media users, who make their purchases from the company exclusively through its branded mobile application, were analysed to test the hypotheses, using structural equation modelling. The results showed that mobile advertising acceptance, intention to repurchase, and recommendation behaviour are driven by the perceived value of the branded mobile app. Perceived value is determined by the usefulness of the branded mobile app, attitudes towards mobile advertising alerts, and irritation. Mobile advertising content (informativeness and credibility) improves attitudes towards mobile advertising alerts. Ease of use increases perceived usefulness, while perceived control decreases irritation. Managerial implications are provided."

In spite of its strategic importance, there is scant attention to investigating customer analytics capabilities in the retail context. Drawing on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, this study proposes a multidimensional customer analytics capability model by identifying relevant dimensions and sub-dimensions in retail settings. The principal contribution of this study is that the model links a customer analytics perspective to a resource-based view (RBV)-capability of the retailers by proposing six customer analytics capability dimensions and twelve sub-dimensions in the spectrum of market orientation and technology orientation. The customer analytics capability dimensions depict three crucial themes of marketing, such as value creation (offering capability and personalization capability), value delivery (distribution capability and communication capability), and value management (data management capability and data protection capability). By incorporating this capability dimensions, practitioners will likely be able to engage customers and enhance customer equity."
85083792970,The effect of privacy choice in cookie notices on consumers' perceived fairness of frequent price changes,Schmidt L.,Psychology and Marketing,2020-09-01,10.1002/mar.21356,37,Handelshochschule Leipzig,Article,"© 2020 The Authors. Psychology & Marketing published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Recent regulatory changes (i.e., General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union) enforce that seller (e.g., retail and service) and all other websites disclose through cookie notices which data they collect and store. At the same time, websites must allow consumers to disagree to the tracking of their browsing behavior. Despite sellers' concern about the loss of consumer insights—as consumers might disagree to the collection of their browsing data—cookie notices might also have a surprising side-effect: Consumers might accept frequent price changes (from personalized or dynamic pricing) more readily, if they agree through a cookie notice that their behavior can be tracked. Specifically, two experimental studies show that consent to the tracking of browsing behavior increases consumers internal attribution of a price change, as consumers attribute the cause of the change (here: giving up data) to themselves. This increases price fairness perceptions and, in turn, purchase intent. As a result, for online sellers of goods or services the implementation of cookie notice should no longer be thought as a matter to be avoided, but rather a trade-off decision: Loss of a part of consumer insights versus higher acceptance of data-driven marketing mix decisions, such as frequent price changes."

Although revenue management of cruise fares is now standard practice, there are untapped opportunities to improve yields through data-driven market segmentation and third-degree price discrimination. This paper uses a finite mixture modeling approach to develop, empirically validate, and compare pricing models. By unveiling segments of travelers based on individual attributes, third-degree price discrimination can improve target marketing, the timing and appeal of price discounts, and the matching of variable demand with fixed, though differentiated, room supply. Empirical results from running thousands of simulations with pricing data from one of the world's largest cruise lines show that the segmentation analysis using third-degree price discrimination can increase fare revenue more than four percent. The modeling approach used in this research extends the emerging literature on revenue management in the cruise industry and offers meaningful managerial implications for advanced pricing tactics and revenue management."

We conducted a design workshop with experienced video, animation designers and visualization experts to discuss principles and practices for augmenting short-form videos with data visualizations. After the workshop, we summarized the participants’ design considerations and proposed 20 design guidelines. We further collected design purposes of the participants and associated these purposes with the guidelines. Finally, we conducted a crowd-sourcing study and a task-based evaluation to validate the effectiveness and usability of the guidelines. Results indicate that our guidelines can significantly improve the videos accompanied with data visualizations and help novices easily obtain desired knowledge when augmenting videos.

85089759302,IoT Inspector: Crowdsourcing Labeled Network Traffic from Smart Home Devices at Scale,Huang D.Y.,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",2020-06-15,10.1145/3397333,87,Princeton University,Article,"© 2020 ACM.The proliferation of smart home devices has created new opportunities for empirical research in ubiquitous computing, ranging from security and privacy to personal health. Yet, data from smart home deployments are hard to come by, and existing empirical studies of smart home devices typically involve only a small number of devices in lab settings. To contribute to data-driven smart home research, we crowdsource the largest known dataset of labeled network traffic from smart home devices from within real-world home networks. To do so, we developed and released IoT Inspector, an open-source tool that allows users to observe the traffic from smart home devices on their own home networks. Between April 10, 2019 and January 21, 2020, 5,404 users have installed IoT Inspector, allowing us to collect labeled network traffic from 54,094 smart home devices. At the time of publication, IoT Inspector is still gaining users and collecting data from more devices. We demonstrate how this data enables new research into smart homes through two case studies focused on security and privacy. First, we find that many device vendors, including Amazon and Google, use outdated TLS versions and send unencrypted traffic, sometimes to advertising and tracking services. Second, we discover that smart TVs from at least 10 vendors communicated with advertising and tracking services. Finally, we find widespread cross-border communications, sometimes unencrypted, between devices and Internet services that are located in countries with potentially poor privacy practices. To facilitate future reproducible research in smart homes, we will release the IoT Inspector data to the public."

Enlisting a behavioral focus, it investigates the item-to-item relationships between brand engagement, attitudes, and conspicuous behaviors both online and offline. Two Bayesian networks were constructed from samples of city website users (N = 1089) and nonusers (N = 475). Results confirm that the five groups of nodes included in our constructed Bayesian networks were well distinguished as separate constructs and interrelated, centered on two nodes of brand engagement. Results also indicate that two nodes of brand engagement, “sense of belonging” and “participating in activities”, induced positive attitudes and were associated with conspicuous behaviors. Overall, this study demonstrates the dynamic, item-to-item relationships between engagement and behaviors of substantive interest. For managers, it is important in practice to discover the particular variables that play central roles among associated variables."

Such information supports planning the inventory at the warehouse and point of sales, as well strategic decisions during manufacturing processes. In this paper, we develop advanced analytics tools that predict future customer behavior in the non-contractual setting. We establish a dynamic and data driven framework for predicting whether a customer is going to make purchase at the company within a certain time frame in the near future. For that purpose, we propose a new set of customer relevant features that derives from times and values of previous purchases. These customer features are updated every month, and state of the art machine learning algorithms are applied for purchase prediction. In our studies, the gradient tree boosting method turns out to be the best performing method. Using a data set containing more than 10 000 customers and a total number of 200 000 purchases we obtain an accuracy score of 89% and an AUC value of 0.95 for predicting next moth purchases on the test data set."

Jansen et al., published by SciendoPersona is a common human-computer interaction technique for increasing stakeholders’ understanding of audiences, customers, or users. Applied in many domains, such as e-commerce, health, marketing, software development, and system design, personas have remained relatively unchanged for several decades. However, with the increasing popularity of digital user data and data science algorithms, there are new opportunities to progressively shift personas from general representations of user segments to precise interactive tools for decision-making. In this vision, the persona profile functions as an interface to a fully functional analytics system. With this research, we conceptually investigate how data-driven personas can be leveraged as analytics tools for understanding users. We present a conceptual framework consisting of (a) persona benefits, (b) analytics benefits, and (c) decision-making outcomes. We apply this framework for an analysis of digital marketing use cases to demonstrate how data-driven personas can be leveraged in practical situations. We then present a functional overview of an actual data-driven persona system that relies on the concept of data aggregation in which the fundamental question defines the unit of analysis for decision-making. The system provides several functionalities for stakeholders within organizations to address this question."

This work presents a scalable methodology for targeting residential customers for EE programs that focus on reducing unnecessary domestic energy consumption and replacing low efficient refrigerator-freezers by using smart meter data and daily temperature data. A novel method is proposed to detect baseload (i.e., power constantly consumed by some appliances that are never turned off) segments from daily load profiles. Test on ground truth data shows the high accuracy performance of the proposed method and its adaptiveness to the heterogeneity in energy consumptions across customers. Then we discuss how the proposed method can be utilized to identify customers with high baseload energy saving potentials and low efficient refrigerator-freezers. Case studies validate that the proposed targeting strategy far outperforms random selection."

Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Objectives The quality and safety of drug therapy in primary care are global concerns. The Pharmacist and Data-Driven Quality Improvement in Primary Care (P-DQIP) intervention aims to improve prescribing safety via an informatics tool, which facilitates proactive management of drug therapy risks (DTRs) by health-board employed pharmacists with established roles in general practices. Study objectives were (1) to identify and prioritise factors that could influence P-DQIP implementation from the perspective of practice pharmacists and (2) to identify potentially effective, acceptable and feasible strategies to support P-DQIP implementation. Design Semistructured face-to-face interviews using a Theoretical Domains Framework informed topic guide. The framework method was used for data analysis. Identified implementation factors were prioritised for intervention based on research team consensus. Candidate intervention functions, behavioural change techniques (BCTs) and policies targeting these were identified from the behavioural change wheel. The final intervention content and modes of delivery were agreed with local senior pharmacists. Setting General practices from three Health and Social Care Partnerships in National Health Service (NHS) Tayside. Participants 14 NHS employed practice pharmacists. Results Identified implementation factors were linked to thirteen theoretical domains (all except intentions) and six (skill, memory/attention/decision making, behavioural regulation, reinforcement, environmental context/resources, social influences) were prioritised. Three intervention functions (training, enablement and environmental restructuring) were relevant and were served by two policy categories (guidelines, communication/marketing) and eight BCTs (instructions on how to perform a behaviour, problem solving, action planning, prompt/cues, goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback and restructuring the social environment). Intervention components encompass an informatics tool, written educational material, a workshop for pharmacists, promotional activities and small financial incentives. Conclusions This study explored pharmacists' perceptions of implementation factors which could influence management of DTRs in general practices to inform implementation of P-DQIP, which will initially be implemented in one Scottish health board with parallel evaluation of effectiveness and implementation."

Considering the reference price effect of consumers, this work constructs differential games among manufacturer, retailer and Internet service platform under three business models of independent, collaborative production and collaborative marketing. Using Bellman's continuous dynamic programming theory, this work obtains the optimal feedback strategies of price and big-data marketing effort, brand goodwill, return rate of used products and corporate profits under the three business models. Comparing the three scenarios and analyzing the sensitivity of key exogenous parameters, it can be found that the involvement of Internet service platform has a crucial impact on the sustainable profitability of supply chain enterprises. Considering the reference price effect of consumers, enterprises should adopt different strategic alliances in different periods, which can also gain new development momentum in the context of data-driven marketing, achieve the improvement of the triple-bottom line of closed-loop supply chain and even reach a win-win situation for supply chain enterprises."

All rights reserved.The application of churn prevention represents an important step for mobile communication companies aiming at increasing customer loyalty. In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk. A case study of a mobile communication company is also presented to explain the proposed procedure, as well as to analyze its real performance and results."

In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set. The system enables development of automated tools for dating site providers and individual users."

A ubiquitous and important retailing segment is grocery stores, yet almost no analytical work in the block design can be found in the literature. This paper uses a data-driven approach coupled with optimization to address block layout in grocery stores with the participation of Migros, the largest retailer in Turkey. The goal is to develop an effective analytical method for solving realistic grocery store block layout problems considering data which describes revenue generation and adjacency of departments. Historic market basket data is used to characterize certain important aspects that relate to customer sales and these are used in a tabu search meta-heuristic to find layouts which are likely to enhance revenue. To consider the objectives of revenue and adjacency simultaneously, a bi-objective approach is used. A set of non-dominated designs is generated for a decision maker to consider further and the generated designs have been validated with a detailed stochastic simulation model and by the marketing experts at Migros. According to the computational results and the feedback from the industry partner, this approach is both effective and pragmatic for a data-driven, analytic design of grocery store block layouts. Layout designs which improve revenues and desired adjacencies relative to the existing store layouts are identified. While this paper focuses on a single retailer, the approach is general and given that grocery layout is similar worldwide, the method and results should be easily translatable to other retailers."

The key challenge on estimating treatment effect in the wild observational studies is to handle confounding bias induced by imbalance of the confounder distributions between treated and control units. Traditional methods remove confounding bias by re-weighting units with supposedly accurate propensity score estimation under the unconfoundedness assumption. Controlling high-dimensional variables may make the unconfoundedness assumption more plausible, but poses new challenge on accurate propensity score estimation. One strand of recent literature seeks to directly optimize weights to balance confounder distributions, bypassing propensity score estimation. But existing balancing methods fail to do selection and differentiation among the pool of a large number of potential confounders, leading to possible underperformance inmany high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a data-driven Differentiated Confounder Balancing (DCB) algorithm to jointly select confounders, differentiate weights of confounders and balance confounder distributions for treatment effect estimation in the wild high-dimensional settings. Besides, under some settings with heavy confounding bias, in order to further reduce the bias and variance of estimated treatment effect, we propose a Regression Adjusted Differentiated Confounder Balancing (RADCB) algorithm based on our DCB algorithm by incorporating outcome regression adjustment. The synergistic learning algorithmswe proposed are more capable of reducing the confounding bias in many observational studies. To validate the effectiveness of our DCB and RA-DCB algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods. By incorporating regression adjustment, our RA-DCB algorithm achieves more precise estimation on treatment effect than DCB algorithm, especially under the settings with heavy confounding bias. Moreover, we show that the top features ranked by our algorithm generate accurate prediction of online advertising effect."

The automatic color design of advertising images is challenging because it must satisfy esthetic goals while also complying with the color design for different content, brand or targeted audience. This paper proposes a data-driven method to color advertising images automatically according to input product color and context-related keywords. To generate good coloring suggestions, we collected 13,000 well-labeled adverting images and built two probabilistic models to capture stylistic color properties. To collect the color preferences of potential users, we developed a color analyzer to display the result of clustering advertising images. Using the visual display, a user can explore and select images to guide our model to generate more personalized colors. We applied our method to three coloring tasks including keyword-based coloring, product-based coloring and user-guide coloring to test its performance against three coloring goals. In perceptual studies, colorings generated by our method were preferred to those generated by other models or created by non-professional students."

We used call detail records (CDRs), customer relationship management (CRM) and billing information as a data source to analyze telecom customer behavior, and applied different types of machine learning algorithms to provide marketing campaigns with more accurate information about customer demographic attributes. This model is built using reliable data set of 18,000 users provided by SyriaTel Telecom Company, for training and testing. The model applied by using big data technology and achieved 85.6% accuracy in terms of user gender prediction and 65.5% of user age prediction. The main contribution of this work is the improvement in the accuracy in terms of user gender prediction and user age prediction based on mobile phone data and end-to-end solution that approaches customer data from multiple aspects in the telecom domain."

All rights reserved.Under the data-driven environment, market competition is increasingly fierce. Enterprises begin to pay attention to precise marketing to make costs down, improve marketing efficiency and competitiveness. E-mail marketing is widely used in enterprises due to its advantages of low cost and wide audience. This paper uses machine-learning techniques such as decision tree, cluster analysis and Naive Bayes algorithm to analyze customer characteristics and attributes with historical purchase records, and further analyzes the key factors that affect potential customers' purchase behavior by selecting models with high promotion degree through promotion graph, to realize accurate marketing. The results show that the prediction effect of decision tree is better than clustering analysis and Naive Bayesian algorithm, and has a higher promotion degree. The customers who are 45-55 years old and commute 1-2 kilometers away are more likely to make purchases if they do not have a car or have a car at home."

Facilitating real-time bidding for audience impressions and personalized targeting, programmatic technologies are at the leading edge of digital, data-driven advertising. But almost no research considers programmatic advertising within a general history of information technology in commercial media industries. The computerization of advertising and media buying remains curiously unexamined. Using archival sources, this study situates programmatic advertising within a longer trajectory, focusing on the incorporation of electronic data processing into the spot television business, starting in the 1950s. The article makes three contributions: it illustrates that (1) demands for information, data processing, and rapid communications have long been central to advertising and media buying; (2) automation “ad tech” developed gradually through efforts to coordinate and accelerate transactions; and (3) the use of computers to increase efficiency and approach mathematical optimization reformatted calculative resources for media and marketing decisions."

However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies."

Since then, brand experience has emerged as one of the solid academic constructs for branding and marketing scholars and practitioners who pursue this competitive strategy for sustainable growth in corporate management. The authors explore the new dimensions of brand experience with big data analytics for the first time in academic research. We propose a possible sixth dimension (""External"") of brand experience which includes sensory, affective, intellectual, behavioral, and social aspects drawn from previous studies. A new methodology for combining topic modeling and conjoint analysis is tested with big data-based multi-level compositions that overcome the limits of the traditional survey-based analysis. Moreover, the study reveals the decision-making frame which combines conjoint analysis and the dimensions of brand experience for practical implications. The novelty of this data-driven research and results contribute to new approaches in academia from the perspectives of brand experience dimensions, topic modeling, and conjoint analysis methodology development. Building sustainable brands, this study contributes to the ways of reading consumer behavior, evaluating the current status of the market and deciding the stimuli to affect consumer behavior."

However, relatively little research has been undertaken into the ways older consumers are adopting or rejecting new digital technologies. Given the shifting economic power and growing digital adoption rates among older consumers, understanding how they adopt technology and use digital channels is becoming increasingly important to marketers. For marketers and policy makers to fully understand the future shape of a data-driven digital society, research must take more account of its influence across different older generational cohorts. This article focuses on identifying research gaps across key digital marketing areas in relation to older-age consumers’ adoption and use of digital technology. Through a multidisciplinary review of the literature on aging, using the theoretical lens of generational cohorts, the authors identify key research challenges, opportunities, and implications for both marketers and policy makers."

The survey was designed to evaluate internet and other digital technology use; digital technology applications deployed on farms; internet and mobile service satisfaction; barriers to technology adoption; and, use differences across groups based on demographic factors that included farm income, farm size, age, education level and gender. After eliminating undelivered/returned mailings, the survey had a 43% response rate (n = 1021). Internet access and use levels were strongly and positively associated with gender (women), farm income, farm size (hectares and numbers of animals) and education level. Higher levels of income, education, and acreage, females and ages under 55 were associated with significantly higher levels of internet access. For both mobile and home/office computer access, cost was an area with higher dissatisfaction along with slow download speed during heavy use periods. Weather and market information were categories of information most often accessed, while farm program and educational information were the categories least accessed. The most significant barriers to adoption of digital technology on respondents’ farms included data privacy and security concerns, software and system compatibility, and understanding how to use and derive value from acquired data. The survey examined areas of digital application adoption including finance and marketing tools and apps, precision planting and harvesting, sensor applications (soil, livestock, structures/environment), and robotic milking equipment and found adoption to increase with acreage, income, youth, and for females. In addition, a case study of two Wisconsin producers quantified and characterized all data generated on their farms in 2017. These producers stored 51 MB per hectare and 73 MB per milking head in 2017. These data provide insight into rural broadband needs that would allow agricultural producers to make data-driven decisions and foster innovation."

This case describes how the development of a course on data-driven marketing makes use of service design methods. The experiential learning innovation is based on the optimization of customer journey mapping, which encompasses theoretical marketing concepts, modern database architecture and practical digital marketing knowledge. As a visualization of individual interactions with a product, service, or brand, customer journey mapping helps explain the way an interaction occurs in one moment and how it influences all other moments. By taking the “data as a service” perspective on the customer journey, students benefit from a more innovative and creative approach to data-driven marketing, which helps improve their attention and motivation."

Through a series of research questions, this exploratory study seeks to define what big data analytics means in marketing practice. It also seeks to uncover the challenges and identifiable stages of big data analytics implementation. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 15 open-ended in-depth interviews were conducted with marketing and analytics executives in a variety of industries in Ireland and the USA. Interview transcripts were subjected to open coding and axial coding to address the research questions. Findings: The study reveals that managers consider marketing big data analytics to be a series of tools and capabilities used to inform product innovation and marketing strategy-making processes and to defend the brand against emerging risks. Additionally, the study reveals that big data analytics implementation is championed at different organizational levels using different types of dynamic learning capabilities, contingent on the champion’s stature within the organization. Originality/value: From the qualitative analysis, it is proposed that marketing departments undergo five stages of big data analytics implementation: sprouting, recognition, commitment, culture shift and data-driven marketing. Each stage identifies the key characteristics and potential pitfalls to be avoided and provides advice to marketing managers on how to implement big data analytics."

However, investigations of how big data helps inform consumers' psychological aspects have, thus far, only received scant attention. Psychographics has been shown to be a valuable market segmentation path in understanding consumer preferences. Although in the context of e-commerce, as a component of psychographic segmentation, personality has been proven to be effective for prediction of e-commerce user preferences, it still remains unclear whether psychographic segmentation is practically influential in understanding user preferences across different product categories. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first quantitative demonstration of the promising effect and relative importance of psychographic segmentation in predicting users' online purchasing preferences across different product categories in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct two online psychographic lexicons that include the Big Five Factor (BFF) personality traits and Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) using natural language processing (NLP) methods that are based on behavior measurements of users' word use. We then incorporate the lexicons in a deep neural network (DNN)-based recommender system to predict users' online purchasing preferences considering the new progress in segmentation-based user preference prediction methods. Overall, segmenting consumers into heterogeneous groups surprisingly does not demonstrate a significant improvement in understanding consumer preferences. Psychographic variables (both BFF and SVS) significantly improve the explanatory power of e-consumer preferences, whereas the improvement in prediction power is not significant. The SVS tends to outperform BFF segmentation, except for some product categories. Additionally, the DNN significantly outperforms previous methods. An e-commerce-oriented SVS measurement and segmentation approach that integrates both BFF and the SVS is recommended. The strong empirical evidence provides both practical guidance for e-commerce product development, marketing and recommendations, and a methodological reference for big data-driven marketing research."

Activity on social media delivers more detailed information compared to viral marketing in traditional media. Monitoring the performance of outdoor campaigns that are carried out using this transportation system is even more complicated because of the lack of data. The approach that is presented in this paper is based on cellular automata and enables the modelling of the information-spreading processes that are initiated by transit advertising within an urban space. The evaluation of classical and graph cellular automata models and a coverage analysis of transit advertising based on tram lines were performed. The results demonstrated how the number of lines affects the performance in terms of coverage within an urban space and the differences between the proposed models. While research is based on an exemplary dataset taken from Szczecin (Poland), the presented framework can be used together with data from the public transport system for modelling advertising resources usage and coverage within the urban space."

What constitutes A&WC is interpreted as the conduct of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, these trials are sometimes unfeasible because of their size, duration, and cost. One way to reduce sample size is to leverage information on the control through a prior. One consideration when forming data-driven prior is the consistency of the external and the current data. It is essential to make this process less susceptible to choosing information that only helps improve the chances toward making an effectiveness claim. For this purpose, propensity score methods are employed for two reasons: (1) it gives the probability of a patient to be in the trial, and (2) it minimizes selection bias by pairing together treatment and control within the trial and control subjects in the external data that are similar in terms of their pretreatment characteristics. Two matching schemes based on propensity scores, estimated through generalized boosted methods, are applied to a real example with the objective of using external data to perform Bayesian augmented control in a trial where the allocation is disproportionate. The simulation results show that the data augmentation process prevents prior and data conflict and improves the precision of the estimator of the average treatment effect."

The present research focuses on analysing the advantages and disadvantages of using mutual information (MI) and data-based sensitivity analysis (DSA) for feature selection in classification problems, by applying both to a bank telemarketing case. A logistic regression model is built on the tuned set of features identified by each of the two techniques as the most influencing set of features on the success of a telemarketing contact, in a total of 13 features for MI and 9 for DSA. The latter performs better for lower values of false positives while the former is slightly better for a higher false-positive ratio. Thus, MI becomes a better choice if the intention is reducing slightly the cost of contacts without risking losing a high number of successes. However, DSA achieved good prediction results with less features."

Groups were focused on general health consumer issues or disease specific topics, and had regional or national jurisdictions. Analysis Analytic techniques were informed by grounded theory. Interview transcripts were coded into data driven categories. Findings were organised into new conceptual categories to describe and explain the data, and were supported by quotes. Results A range of attitudes towards pharmaceutical industry sponsorship were identified that are presented as four different types of relationship between patient groups and the pharmaceutical industry. The dominant relationship type was of a successful business partnership, and participants described close working relationships with industry personnel. These participants acknowledged a potential for adverse industry influence, but expressed confidence in existing strategies for avoiding industry influence. Other participants described unsatisfactory or undeveloped relationships, and some participants (all from general health consumer groups) presented their groups' missions as incompatible with the pharmaceutical industry because of fundamentally opposing interests. Participants reported that interactions between their patient group and pharmaceutical companies were more common when companies had new drugs of potential interest to group members. Patient groups that accepted industry funding engaged in exchanges of ""assets"" with companies. Groups received money, information, and advice in exchange for providing companies with marketing, relationship building opportunities with key opinion leaders, coordinated lobbying with companies about drug access and subsidy, assisting companies with clinical trial recruitment, and enhancing company credibility. Conclusions An understanding of the range of views patient groups have about pharmaceutical company sponsorship will be useful for groups that seek to identify and manage any ethical concerns about these relationships. Patient groups that receive pharmaceutical industry money should anticipate they might be asked for specific assets in return. Selective industry funding of groups where active product marketing opportunities exist might skew the patient group sector's activity towards pharmaceutical industry interests and allow industry to exert proxy influence over advocacy and subsequent health policy."

The sample was extracted from user generated content (UGC) from Twitter using two methods based on knowledge extraction techniques for business. In Method 1, an algorithm to detect communities in complex networks was applied; this algorithm, in which we applied data visualization techniques for complex networks analysis, used the modularity of nodes to discover topics. In Method 2, a three-phase process was developed for knowledge extraction that included the application of a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, a sentiment analysis (SA) that works with machine learning, and a data text mining (DTM) analysis technique. Finally, we compared the results of each of the two techniques to see whether or not the results yielded by these two methods regarding the analysis of companies' digital marketing strategies were mutually complementary."

In this context, business analytics offer the opportunity to harness the knowledge and value hidden within enterprise information systems to revolutionize innovation, enhance supply chain management and production, accurately target marketing and sales efforts, as well as develop and manage profitable after-sales services. While the literature to date presents numerous specific applications in which business analytics techniques were successfully deployed to improve specific business units, it is evident that a comprehensive enterprise approach is missing. In the present work, a pathway to attain market leadership through the effective use of business analytics is defined suggesting focus must center on three increasingly challenging barriers. Firstly, “standardization” of collection, aggregation and storage of data must be accomplished. Then, an “organizational culture evolution” that outgrows intuition and embraces data-driven decision-making is needed to create the perfect ecosystem for business analytics to produce actionable results and recommendations. In turn, these must guide “business model innovation” efforts to tackle new value creation, and capture and secure market leadership."

However, the current studies leave much to be further explored. This study constructed a conceptual model based on cue utilization theory focusing on the effects of consumer perceptions to the personalized online ads on click-through intention. Empirical results based on data from a survey of 446 WeChat moments users in China showed that: (1)consumer's ad click-through intention increased as a result of employing a higher extent of product involvement, brand familiarity, visual attractiveness and information quality to consumer; (2)trust played a role of mediation in the processes of visual attractiveness and information quality affecting click-through intention; (3)the higher product involvement also stimulated the consumer's privacy concerns, which played negative moderating effects on the positive impacts of product involvement, brand familiarity and trust on click-through intention. The findings contributed to the precision marketing literature by enriching an understanding of psychological mechanism underlying consumers' perception and cognitive factors toward the personalized online ads."

These patterns have a positive effect on vehicle energy consumption. In this paper, a two-level clustering model is proposed to determine the driving patterns of electric vehicles. Firstly, the driving pattern characteristics are extracted from the data set of the electric vehicles. Then, the driving patterns including daily driving patterns and multifaceted driving patterns are obtained by a two-level clustering model. The data of 1463 electric vehicles in China were collected from September 1, 2015, to September 1, 2016. Using the proposed model, we obtain five types of daily driving patterns and four types of multifaceted driving patterns. Then, the features of clusters are extracted, and the geographical distribution analysis of the multifaceted driving patterns is conducted. The experimental results reveal that there are many driving patterns of the electric vehicles. Moreover, the effectiveness of the clustering models is verified by the experiments. The customer segmentation based on the driving patterns of electric vehicles is of a great significance for the development of personalized and targeted marketing strategies of vehicle manufacturers and energy efficiency improvement."

This new automated fare card/smart card system integrates many parts of a transit fare system, such as physical card, fare product, purchase information, and transit use location. The data are also integrated on a much longer timeframe than the previous generation transit card system. Increased data longevity allows the CTA to embark on a longitudinal study of transit card usage by separating cards in a priori groups. In a period between May 2016 and May 2017, a slight decrease in cards used in the system led to a small ridership drop, but a larger drop in ridership was found in passengers who used the system from one year to the next. This longitudinal application of passenger utilization of the transit network provides the agency with additional information that can be used to adjust fare policies and start marketing campaigns based on customer usages. This allows the agency to improve decision-making ability with greater insight on customer behavior."

We combine data on the growth of fashion designs, price markups, and industry statistics to develop a formal analysis of the essential questions at the base of the debate. We distinguish between three effects: Acceleration, whereby the presence of a pirated design increases the awareness of the design; Substitution, which represents the loss of sales due to consumers who would have purchased the original design, yet instead buy the knockoff; and loss because of Overexposure of the design resulting from the design's ubiquity. Using data-driven simulation analysis, we find that for the items analyzed (handbags and apparel), overexposure emerged as having a stronger negative effect (on average) on the original's profitability than the positive effect of acceleration. Both effects are considerably larger than that of substitution. This result is of particular interest given that industry groups have consistently focused on the damage caused by substitution. We also show that the effect of a legally mandated postponement on the introduction of a knockoff is non-monotonic for short lag: A short time lag may not affect the original design's NPV, and in fact may even damage it. For the ranges we analyzed, the positive effect of the protection period is observed primarily for time lags of over one year."

However, it is very likely that trends or short-term variations in consumers’ intrinsic brand utilities or sensitivities to marketing instruments occur. For example, preferences for specific brands or price elasticities in product categories such as coffee or chocolate may vary in the run-up to festive occasions like Easter or Christmas. In this paper, we employ flexible multinomial logit models for estimating time-varying effects in brand choice behavior. Time-varying brand intercepts and time-varying effects of covariates are modeled using penalized splines, a flexible, yet parsimonious, nonparametric smoothing technique. The estimation is data driven; the flexible functions, as well as the corresponding degrees of smoothness, are determined simultaneously in a unified approach. Our model further allows for alternative-specific time-varying effects of covariates and can mimic state-space approaches with random walk parameter dynamics. In an empirical application for ground coffee, we compare the performance of the proposed approach to a number of benchmark models regarding in-sample fit, information criteria, and in particular out-of-sample fit. Interestingly, the most complex P-spline model with time-varying brand intercepts and brand-specific time-varying covariate effects outperforms all other specifications both in- and out-of-sample. We further present results from a sensitivity analysis on how the number of knots and other P-spline settings affect the model performance, and we provide guidelines for the model building process about the many options for model specification using P-splines. Finally, the resulting parameter paths provide valuable insights for marketing managers."

As a result, Web publishers are now facing a challenging decision of allocating the ad inventory across multiple advertising models, which has a direct and important influence on both their individual revenues, and the market-wide supply-demand balance. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical ad inventory allocation framework (AIAF), taking into consideration the possible scenarios of ad inventory allocation in programmatic advertising markets. AIAF explicitly captures the specific features of ad inventory allocation in each of three levels (i.e., channel level, market level and platform level), and also their influence-feedback effects. We present the general solution process for solving this model on the basis of its property analysis. An illustrative instantiation of our AIAF model is formulated to demonstrate its applications in supporting publishers’ decision-making on the ad inventory allocation. We also conduct experiments based on empirical data so as to validate the model and analysis. Our research findings indicate that 1) our AIAF model outperforms other single-level and two-level allocation strategies; 2) the fine-grained optimization is superior to that of the coarse-grained level; 3) allocation decisions should be made on the basis of the comparative marginal revenue instead of the absolute marginal revenue."
85050619256,A data-driven method to detect adverse drug events from prescription data,Zhan C.,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,2018-09-01,10.1016/j.jbi.2018.07.013,9,University of South Australia,Article,"© 2018 Elsevier Inc.Drug safety issues such as Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) can cause serious consequences for the public. The clinical trials that are undertaken to assess medicine efficacy and safety prior to marketing, generally, may provide sufficient samples for discovering common ADEs. However, more samples are needed to detect infrequent and rare events. Additionally, clinical trials may not include all subgroups of patients. For these reasons, post-marketing surveillance of medicines is necessary for identifying drug safety issues. Most regulatory agencies use the Spontaneous Reporting Systems to identify associations between medicines and suspected ADEs. Data mining with effective analytical frameworks and large-scale medical data is potentially an alternative method to discover and monitor ADEs. In the present paper, we aim to detect potential ADEs from prescription data by discovering ADE associated prescription sequences. In an ADE associated prescription sequence 〈Dp→Ds〉 the prior medicine Dp leads to an ADE for which the succeeding medicine Ds is dispensed to treat. We propose a data-driven method which integrates (1) a constrained sequential pattern mining to uncover prescription sequences as potential signals of ADEs, (2) domain constraints to eliminate interference signals and (3) an adapted Self-Controlled Case Series model to evaluate the potential signals of ADEs. Despite ample prior works using Electronic Health Records (EHRs), our method utilises pure prescription data which does not contain additional information, e.g. symptoms or diagnoses as included in EHRs. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we apply it to a real-world dataset from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of Australia. The dataset contains over 50 million records covering approximately 2 million patients. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying both known ADEs and unknown yet suspicious ADEs with limited detection of false positive signals. Comparing to a recognised gold standard, our method successfully detects 67.4% of the positive adverse events while only 8.78% false positives exist."

In most applications, parameters representing brand intercepts and covariate effects are assumed to be constant over time. However, marketing theories, as well as the experience of marketing practitioners, suggest the existence of trends or short-term variations in particular parameters. Hence, having constant parameters over time is a highly restrictive assumption, which is not necessarily justified in a marketing context and may lead to biased inferences and misleading managerial insights. In this paper, we develop flexible, heterogeneous multinomial logit models based on penalized splines to estimate time-varying parameters. The estimation procedure is fully data-driven, determining the flexible function estimates and the corresponding degree of smoothness in a unified approach. The model flexibly accounts for parameter dynamics without any prior knowledge needed by the analyst or decision maker. Thus, we position our approach as an exploratory tool that can uncover interesting and managerially relevant parameter paths from the data without imposing assumptions on their shape and smoothness. Our approach further allows for heterogeneity in all parameters by additively decomposing parameter variation into time variation (at the population level) and cross-sectional heterogeneity (at the individual household level). It comprises models without time-varying parameters or heterogeneity, as well as random walk parameter evolutions used in recent state space models, as special cases. The results of our extensive model comparison suggest that models considering parameter dynamics and household heterogeneity outperform less complex models regarding fit and predictive validity. Although models with random walk dynamics for brand intercepts and covariate effects perform well, the proposed semiparametric approach still provides a higher predictive validity for two of the three data sets analyzed. For joint estimation of all regression coefficients and hyperparameters, we employ the publicly available software BayesX, making the proposed approach directly applicable."

Firstly, the customers’ features are extracted based on experts’ knowledge. So, we get the customer decision table. After that, the maximum certainty of each class union is used as the corresponding variable threshold value to control the decision rule extraction program. Therefore, the extracted decision rules can reflect the data characteristics effectively.

The same scent can be interpreted differently when different names are assigned to it. Thus, choosing the right scent name can increase competitiveness by successfully appealing to desired consumer segments.

Based on a large web-based dataset of scented products across multiple brands and categories, this article is the first to construct a typology of scent names empirically: unscented, concrete, abstract, and proprietary. After examining firms’ assortments of scented products with different names across 12 categories and comparing them with consumers’ preferences concerning such assortments, we identify major gaps. Overall, consumers demand far more unscented products and products with abstract names than currently offered; however, preferences for products with proprietary names are mostly aligned. Strategic recommendations center on naming scented products to better align supply and demand in the scented product market and capture new market opportunities."

The customers must acquire this knowledge through social learning from other social medias such as reviews on Yelp. Additionally, the quality of a deal depends on both the state of the vendor and decisions of other customers on Groupon. How social learning and network externality affect the decisions of customers in deal selection on Groupon is our main interest. We develop a data-driven game-theoretic framework to understand the rational deal selection behaviors cross social medias. The sufficient condition of the Nash equilibrium is identified. A value-iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal deal selection strategy. We conduct a year-long experiment to trace the competitions among deals on Groupon and the corresponding Yelp ratings. We utilize the dataset to analyze the deal selection game with realistic settings. Finally, the performance of the proposed social learning framework is evaluated with real data. The results suggest that customers do make decisions in a rational way instead of following naive strategies, and there is still room to improve their decisions with assistance from the proposed framework."

The authors-an interdisciplinary team from academia, the private sector, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-participated in the Code-a-Thon as part of the prevention track. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and deploy a methodology using machine learning to accurately detect the marketing and sale of opioids by illicit online sellers via Twitter as part of participation at the HHS Opioid Code-a-Thon event. Methods: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public application programming interface stream filtered for common prescription opioid keywords in conjunction with participation in the Code-a-Thon from November 15, 2017 to December 5, 2017. An unsupervised machine learning-based approach was developed and used during the Code-a-Thon competition (24 hours) to obtain a summary of the content of the tweets to isolate those clusters associated with illegal online marketing and sale using a biterm topic model (BTM). After isolating relevant tweets, hyperlinks associated with these tweets were reviewed to assess the characteristics of illegal online sellers. Results: We collected and analyzed 213,041 tweets over the course of the Code-a-Thon containing keywords codeine, percocet, vicodin, oxycontin, oxycodone, fentanyl, and hydrocodone. Using BTM, 0.32% (692/213,041) tweets were identified as being associated with illegal online marketing and sale of prescription opioids. After removing duplicates and dead links, we identified 34 unique “live” tweets, with 44% (15/34) directing consumers to illicit online pharmacies, 32% (11/34) linked to individual drug sellers, and 21% (7/34) used by marketing affiliates. In addition to offering the “no prescription” sale of opioids, many of these vendors also sold other controlled substances and illicit drugs. Conclusions: The results of this study are in line with prior studies that have identified social media platforms, including Twitter, as a potential conduit for supply and sale of illicit opioids. To translate these results into action, authors also developed a prototype wireframe for the purposes of detecting, classifying, and reporting illicit online pharmacy tweets selling controlled substances illegally to the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Further development of solutions based on these methods has the potential to proactively alert regulators and law enforcement agencies of illegal opioid sales, while also making the online environment safer for the public."
85031824387,An impulse to exploit: the behavioral turn in data-driven marketing,Nadler A.,Critical Studies in Media Communication,2018-03-15,10.1080/15295036.2017.1387279,37,Ursinus College,Article,"© 2017 National Communication Association.Industry advocates argue that by tailoring services and commercial solicitations to match media users’ personal interests, data-driven marketing benefits both consumers and businesses. This article shows, however, that advertisers and marketers who are taking up ideas and techniques from behavioral economics tell their clients a very different story about the aims and use of digital marketing and consumer surveillance. Listening in on this discourse demonstrates that some digital marketers conceptualize their own practices as forms of social control, appropriating concepts from behavioral economics to identify consumers’ cognitive and affective biases and target their vulnerabilities. Behavioral economics recognizes that economic decisions are not simply dictated by rational self-interest; rather, such choices depend on cognitive heuristics and habits, and can be manipulated through the design of “choice architecture.” This article discusses implications of the behavioral turn in data-driven marketing for critical advertising scholars, public advocates, and regulators."

Predicting top persuaders is critical to an expanding array of important social network-centric applications, such as viral marketing, customer retention, and political message promotion. This study formulates the top persuader prediction problem and develops a novel method to predict top persuaders. Our method development is rooted in eminent social network theories that reveal several forces central to social persuasion, including social influence, entity similarity, and structural equivalence. Our method innovatively integrates these forces to predict top persuaders in a social network, in contrast to existing methods that primarily focus on social influence. Specifically, we introduce persuasion probability that denotes the likelihood of persuasion conditioned on these forces. We then propose how to estimate persuasion probabilities, develop an algorithm to predict top persuaders using the estimated persuasion probabilities, and analyze the theoretical property of the algorithm. We conduct an extensive evaluation with real-world social network data and show that our method substantially outperforms prevalent methods from representative previous research and salient industry practices."
85060934899,"Responsible gambling:The need for collaborative government, industry, community and consumer involvement",Blaszczynski A.,Sucht,2018-01-01,10.1024/0939-5911/a000564,7,The University of Sydney,Article,"© 2018 Hogrefe AG.Background: Tensions exist with various stakeholders facing competing interests in providing legal land-based and online regulated gambling products. Threats to revenue/taxation occur in response to harm minimisation and responsible gambling policies. Setting aside the concept of total prohibition, the objectives of responsible gambling are to encourage and/or restrict an individual's gambling expenditure in terms of money and time to personally affordable limits. Stakeholder responsibilities: Governments craft the gambling environment through legislation, monitor compliance with regulatory requirements, and receive taxation revenue as a proportion of expenditure. Industry operators on the other hand, compete across market sectors through marketing and advertising, and through the development of commercially innovative products, reaping substantial financial rewards. Concurrently, governments are driven to respond to community pressures to minimize the range of negative gambling-related social, personal and economic harms and costs. Industry operators are exposed to the same pressures but additionally overlaid with the self-interest of avoiding the imposition of more stringent restrictive policies. Cooperation of stakeholders: The resulting tension between taxation revenue and profit making, harm minimization, and social impacts creates a climate of conflict between all involved parties. Data-driven policies become compromised by unsubstantiated claims of, and counter claims against, the nature and extent of gambling-related harms, effectiveness of policy strategies, with allegations of bias and influence associated with researchers supported by industry and government research funding sources. Conclusion: To effectively advance policies, it is argued that it is imperative that all parties collaborate in a cooperative manner to achieve the objectives of responsible gambling and harm minimization. This extends to and includes more transparent funding for researchers from both government and industry. Continued reliance on data collected from analogue populations or volunteers participating in simulated gambling tasks will not provide data capable of valid and reliable extrapolation to real gamblers in real venues risking their own funds. Failure to adhere to principles of corporate responsibility and consumer protection by both governments and industry will challenge the social licence to offer gambling products. Appropriate and transparent safeguards learnt from the tobacco and alcohol field, it is argued, can guide the conduct of gambling research."

This lacuna is troubling, as consumers have much control over the data being collected. Missing or manipulated data could lead to inferior segmentation. The current work proposes a model of prior-free segmentation, inspired by models of facility location and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first segmentation mechanism that addresses incentive compatibility, efficient market segmentation, and privacy in the absence of a common prior."

Big data strategies by their very nature and modalities lead to heightened levels of information asymmetry which by default have the capacity to disempower the very user that contributes towards the data driven insights. The fundamental driver for writing this paper is not to criticise big data strategies per se, but to suggest; it is merely a tool which can be equally used for consumer entrapment, as well as consumer empowerment. This paper wishes to contribute to the intellectual debate among academics, policy maker, and practitioners alike; en-route for a type of big data-driven managerial orientation that balances the consumers’ right to market-based transparency, and the enterprise’s need for economic viability."

While public health research has documented the activities of brands and consumers related to alcohol promotion and consumption on social media, there remains the need to develop an account of the native, participatory and data-driven advertising model of these platforms. This article examines the relationship between alcohol brands, media platforms and their users by analysing the activity of the 20 most popular alcohol brands’ Australian Facebook pages in 2012 and 2014. We report that the number of fans of alcohol brands increased by 52% from 2012 to 2014. While the number of posts dropped 12% from 2012 and 2014, total interactions with posts by users increased by 9%. Overall, brand activity and engagement became more consistent between 2012 and 2014. We argue that the changing character of user engagement with alcohol brands on Facebook can be related to changes in the platform architecture. Facebook is orchestrating a shift from exposure to engagement as its key advertising metric, and thus departing substantially from established mass media advertising paradigms. Effective policy responses to alcohol marketing in the digital era depend on a more rigorous examination of the marketing infrastructure of social media platforms."

Some innovations become a success; others don’t. Forecasting which innovations will succeed at the beginning of their lifecycle is hard. In this paper, we provide a data-driven, large-scale account of the existence of a special niche among early adopters, individuals that consistently tend to adopt successful innovations before they reach success: we will call them Hit-Savvy. Hit-Savvy can be discovered in very different markets and retain over time their ability to anticipate the success of innovations. As our second contribution, we devise a predictive analytical process, exploiting Hit-Savvy as signals, which achieves high accuracy in the early-stage prediction of successful innovations, far beyond the reach of state-of-the-art time series forecasting models. Indeed, our findings and predictive model can be fruitfully used to support marketing strategies and product placement."

Considering the case of the constantly growing online food selections, we discuss choice-based conjoint analysis and explore the opportunities for behavior analysts to examine the interrelationships of multiple variables and socially important choice settings, and to promote desired behaviors. We show a few examples of using trade-off analyses in online food retail to understand consumer behavior with respect to healthy food items. As demonstrated in these examples based on our own pilot research, conjoint analysis can be used for complex behavior—that which is not amenable directly to an experimental analysis—or as an efficient initial step before moving into further experiments or analyses using biometrics (e.g., eye-tracking) or web analytics conducted in different settings such as e-commerce, e-mail, social media, or on mobile platforms. This paper summarizes the personalized, data driven economic analysis that is possible with a choice-based conjoint analysis."

All Rights Reserved.Introduction: Population health interventions in the retail food environment, such as corner store interventions, aim to influence the kind of cues consumers receive so that they are more often directed toward healthier options. Research that addresses financial aspects of retail interventions, particularly using outcome measures such as store sales that are central to retail decision making, is limited. This study explored store sales over time and across product categories during a healthy corner store intervention in a low-income neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario. Methods: Sales data (from August 2014 to April 2015) were aggregated by product category and by day. We used Microsoft Excel pivot tables to summarize and visually present sales data. We conducted t-tests to examine differences in product category sales by “peak” versus “nonpeak” sales days. Results: Overall store sales peaked on the days at the end of each month, aligned with the issuing of social assistance payments. Revenue spikes on peak sales days were driven predominantly by transit pass sales. On peak sales days, mean sales of nonnutritious snacks and cigarettes were marginally higher than on other days of the month. Finally, creative strategies to increase sales of fresh vegetables and fruits seemed to substantially increase revenue from these product categories. Conclusion: Store sales data is an important store-level metric of food environment intervention success. Furthermore, data-driven decision making by retailers can be important for tailoring interventions. Future interventions and research should consider partnerships and additional success metrics for retail food environment interventions in diverse Canadian contexts."
85030228859,Higher patient satisfaction with antidepressants correlates with earlier drug release dates across online user-generated medical databases,Siskind S.,Pharmacology Research and Perspectives,2017-10-01,10.1002/prp2.355,0,Trinity Health Michigan,Article,"© 2017 The Authors. Pharmacology Research & Perspectives published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd, British Pharmacological Society and American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.Studies establishing the use of new antidepressants often rely simply on proving efficacy of a new compound, comparing against placebo and single compound. The advent of large online databases in which patients themselves rate drugs allows for a new Big Data–driven approach to compare the efficacy and patient satisfaction with sample sizes exceeding previous studies. Exemplifying this approach with antidepressants, we show that patient satisfaction with a drug anticorrelates with its release date with high significance, across different online user-driven databases. This finding suggests that a systematic reevaluation of current, often patent-protected drugs compared to their older predecessors may be helpful, especially given that the efficacy of newer agents relative to older classes of antidepressants such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) is as yet quantitatively unexplored."

The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network-level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1 ) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies."

In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research."

Different stages imply different preferences and consumer demands. Thus, life stages play an important role in marketing, economics, and sociology. However, such information is difficult to be obtained especially in the digital world. This work thus contributed to both theory and practice from two aspects. First, we conducted a large-scale empirical study with 1435 participants and showed that a person's mobile app adoption pattern is strongly influenced by her current life stage. Second, we presented a data-driven, highly-scalable, and real-time approach of predicting an individual's current life stage based on the apps she has installed on smartphone. Result showed that our predictive models were able to predict life stages with 241.0% higher precision and 148.2% higher recall than a random guess on average."

Because going overseas requires a substantial amount of resources, the process of country evaluation and selection is important in a firm's decision making. Despite an emerging interest and need for the systematic evaluation of countries, existing studies remain limited to case studies for one or a few countries because of the lack of multiple country databases. To overcome this limitation, this paper performs a quantitative analysis to classify countries in the construction industry. Based on international marketing theory and a literature review, the authors not only identify country classification variables but also suggest an analytical approach for diagnosing multidimensional aspects of countries in terms of country attractiveness and past project performance. To evaluate 32 countries, this study uses international institutional (construction industry-specific and country-specific) data and project-level data for Korean firms over the 25-year period from 1990 to 2014. Using a factor analysis and cluster analysis, this study classifies 32 countries according to four different factors (business environment, market opportunity, the possibility of project success, and market experience) and explains each country's current status. Compared with existing country risk indices, which provide only one deterministic value, the proposed approach has the potential to capture construction industry-specific trends and actual project performance, enabling firms to not only evaluate and classify candidate countries in a timely manner but also to make better decisions when addressing country-related problems in the construction industry."

As one of the first in its field, the purpose of this paper is to explore what the future of HR analytics might look like. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 20 practitioners of HR analytics, based in 11 large Dutch organizations, the authors investigated what the application, value, structure, and system support of HR analytics might look like in 2025. Findings: The findings suggest that, by 2025, HR analytics will have become an established discipline, will have a proven impact on business outcomes, and will have a strong influence in operational and strategic decision making. Furthermore, the development of HR analytics will be characterized by integration, with data and IT infrastructure integrated across disciplines and even across organizational boundaries. Moreover, the HR analytics function may very well be subsumed in a central analytics function – transcending individual disciplines such as marketing, finance, and HRM. Practical implications: The results of the research imply that HR analytics, as a separate function, department, or team, may very well cease to exist, even before it reaches maturity. Originality/value: Empirical research on HR analytics is scarce, and studies on scenarios, values, and structures of expected developments in HR analytics are non-existent. This research intends to contribute to a better understanding of the development of HR analytics, to facilitate business and HR leaders in taking informed decisions on investing in the further development of the HR analytics discipline. Such investments may lead to an enhanced HR analytics capability within organizations, and cultivate the fact-based and data-driven culture that many organizations and leaders try to pursue."

This article describes how a reporting process can be used to help manage and improve a wellness program. Beginning in 2014, a wellness pilot program became available in New Jersey for individuals with an AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance plan insured by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company. The program has since expanded to include Missouri, Texas, Alabama, and Washington. This wellness program includes an online health portal, one-on-one telephonic coaching, gym membership discounts, and local health events. To assure smooth program operations and alignment with program objectives, weekly and monthly reports are produced. The weekly report includes metrics on member engagement and utilization for the aforementioned 4 program offerings and reports on the last 4 weeks, as well as for the current month and the current year to date. The monthly report includes separate worksheets for each state and a summary worksheet that includes all states combined, and provides metrics on overall engagement as well as utilization of the 4 program components. Although the monthly reports were used to better manage the 4 program offerings, the weekly reports help management to gauge response to program marketing. Reporting can be a data-driven management tool to help manage wellness programs. Reports provide rapid feedback regarding program performance. In contrast, in-depth program evaluations serve a different purpose, such as to report program-related savings, return on investment, or to report other longer term program-related outcomes."

However, there is a gap between the availability of data and the application of extracted knowledge for improving decision support. In fact, more data do not necessarily imply better predictive data-driven marketing models, since it is often the case that the problem domain requires a deeper characterization. Aiming at such characterization, we propose a framework drawn on three feature selection strategies, where the goal is to unveil novel features that can effectively increase the value of data by providing a richer characterization of the problem domain. Such strategies involve encompassing context (e.g., social and economic variables), evaluating past history, and disaggregate the main problem into smaller but interesting subproblems. The framework is evaluated through an empirical analysis for a real bank telemarketing application, with the results proving the benefits of such approach, as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased with each stage, improving previous model in terms of predictive performance."

As more individuals require insulin as part of their treatment, technology evolves to optimize delivery, improve adherence, and reduce dosing errors. Insulin pens outperform vial and syringe in simplicity, dosing accuracy, and user preference. Bolus advisors improve dosing confidence and treatment adherence. The InPen System offers a novel approach to treatment via a wireless pen that syncs to a mobile application featuring a bolus advisor, enabling convenient insulin dose tracking and more accurate bolus advice among other features. Areas covered: Existing technology for insulin delivery and bolus advice are reviewed. The mechanics and functionality of the InPen device are delineated. Findings from formative testing and usability studies of the InPen system are reported. Future directions for the InPen system in the treatment of diabetes are discussed. Expert opinion: Diabetes management is complex and largely data-driven. The InPen System offers a promising new opportunity to avail insulin pen-users of features known to improve treatment efficacy, which have otherwise primarily been available to those using pumps. Given that the majority of insulin users do not use insulin pumps, the InPen System is poised to improve glucose control in a significant portion of the diabetes population."

Clearly, the traditional stage-gate process employed in new product development is not dynamic enough, nor tactical enough, to provide a product’s success. The new product development process should address each stakeholder’s perspective (i.e. payers, patients, hospitals/healthcare systems, and governmental agencies) and generate data and corresponding messaging that speaks to them. Incorporating a global launch strategy, which is common today, amplifies the data burden when one considers each country’s constellation of stakeholder groups and regulatory requirements. Thus, launch strategies must map out total required stakeholder data needs before launch to capture efficiencies and lower total costs. This type of new product development process requires a unique team in place at the beginning of the product cycle. The Core Team must be an integrated, collaborative, flexible, cross-functional team that incorporates core strategic functions (Clinical, Regulatory, Legal, R&D, Reimbursement, Engineering, Sales and Marketing), but also has the ability to execute the tactical plans. The members’ differing perspectives inform the data-driven marketing and launch plans, claims matrices, key message development, competitive analysis, clinical publication strategy, and market conditioning plan. This article will address the gaps we have observed in the traditional stage-gate new product development process in the current healthcare landscape and will outline the marketing best practices we have used to bridge those gaps: creating an integrated customer engagement roadmap that fully aligns with a value-oriented global market and executing that roadmap with the cross-functional expertise of a Core Team."

A combination of factors had resulted in a dysfunctional immunization cold chain and supply chain. Recognizing that the number of unimmunized children contributed to high levels of under-5-mortality, and that health MDGs would not be attained, Minister of State for Health Mohammed Pate launched a vaccines transformation project in 2013. In partnership with BMGF, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO, other donors and implementing partners the transformation journey has so far taken three years and achieved impressive results. It has though faced challenges along the way and with the financial burden of GAVI graduation facing Nigeria, the economic downturn and the decentralized funding of health services, the results are far from sustained. This paper documents the work undertaken at the Federal level and then highlights specific work undertaken in partnership with Lagos State Government. It identifies the importance of taking an end to end approach and looking at the root causes of weak system performance. The strategy combined simple innovations in how data was captured, recorded and used to drive decision making. It included a comprehensive and systematic approach to cold chain procurement, installation and maintenance with a shift to a culture of active cold chain maintenance that is performing with higher levels of uptime. It also included supply chain redesign at both the Federal and State level. Finally, it involved an institutional transformation at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to establish a data driven Department of Logistics and Health Commodities (DLHC) to manage the many challenges in immunizing 7.5 million children annually. While results have been impressive, there have been many challenges and lessons learned on the way. As Nigeria gets ready for its graduation from GAVI, a robust agile performing cold chain and supply chain will be essential for the good health of Nigeria's children and its economy.

An application of support vector machines based on the AUC parameter-selection technique in B2B e-commerce industry,Gordini N.,Industrial Marketing Management,2017-04-01,10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.08.003,95,Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca,Article,"© 2016 Elsevier Inc.E-commerce has provided new opportunities for both businesses and consumers to easily share information, find and buy a product, increasing the ease of movement from one company to another as well as to increase the risk of churn. In this study we develop a churn prediction model tailored for B2B e-commerce industry by testing the forecasting capability of a new model, the support vector machine (SVM) based on the AUC parameter-selection technique (SVMauc). The predictive performance of SVMauc is benchmarked to logistic regression, neural network and classic support vector machine. Our study shows that the parameter optimization procedure plays an important role in the predictive performance and the SVMauc points out good generalization performance when applied to noisy, imbalance and nonlinear marketing data outperforming the other methods. Thus, our findings confirm that the data-driven approach to churn prediction and the development of retention strategies outperforms commonly used managerial heuristics in B2B e-commerce industry."
84966700854,Uncovering and predicting the dynamic process of information cascades with survival model,Yu L.,Knowledge and Information Systems,2017-02-01,10.1007/s10115-016-0955-7,17,Tsinghua University,Article,"© 2016, Springer-Verlag London.Cascades are ubiquitous in various network environments. Predicting these cascades is decidedly nontrivial in various important applications, such as viral marketing, epidemic prevention, and traffic management. Most previous works have focused on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are dynamic processes, it is always interesting and important to predict the cascade size at any given time, or to predict the time when a cascade will reach a certain size (e.g., the threshold for an outbreak). In this paper, we unify all these tasks into a fundamental problem: cascading process prediction. That is, given the early stage of a cascade, can we predict its cumulative cascade size at any later time? For such a challenging problem, an understanding of the micromechanism that drives and generates the macrophenomena (i.e., the cascading process) is essential. Here, we introduce behavioral dynamics as the micromechanism to describe the dynamic process of an infected node’s neighbors getting infected by a cascade (i.e., one-hop sub-cascades). Through data-driven analysis, we find out the common principles and patterns lying in the behavioral dynamics and propose the novel NEtworked WEibull Regression model for modeling it. We also propose a novel method for predicting cascading processes by effectively aggregating behavioral dynamics and present a scalable solution to approximate the cascading process with a theoretical guarantee. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on a large-scale social network dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods in multiple tasks including cascade size prediction, outbreak time prediction, and cascading process prediction."
85022202688,Improving banner ad strategies through predictive modeling,Obal M.W.,Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,2017-01-01,10.1108/JRIM-08-2016-0092,8,University of Massachusetts Lowell,Article,"© 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory, data-driven study is to identify the optimal banner advertising strategies for achieving different business metric goals, such as effective cost per activity, via unique predictive modelling methods. Design/methodology/approach: The k-fold cross-validation method is used to build predictive models to analyze 18,956 online banner advertising records. Findings: Banner ads with high visual complexity and attractive offers tend to draw users to participate in online activities, whereas voluntary banner ads with low visual complexity tend to draw user clicks. Further, banner ads with lower visual complexity tend to have lower costs. Finally, the third quarter of a year is the most important period for online advertising campaigns in terms of achieving the optimal effectiveness and cost for running internet banner ads. Research limitations/implications: As only visual and temporal characteristics of internet banner ads are covered in this study, future research should concentrate on the specific language within each banner ad message. Further, this study does not specifically tie internet-specific metrics, such as activities, costs and clicks to business metrics, such as revenue and profit. Practical implications: Advertisers can use the findings from this study to create an effective and cost-efficient banner advertising strategy. Specifically, firms should use larger banner ads with features and offers, advertise at the end of the year and use caution with rich media expandable banners and banner ad videos as they can significantly increase costs. Originality/value: This is one of the first exploratory studies to use the k-fold cross-validation method to build predictive models to identify visual and temporal factors that significantly impact the effectiveness and cost of internet banner ads."

The recent advancements in sensor based technologies hold the promise of novel energy consumption models that can better characterize the underlying patterns. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic data-driven predictive model for consumption forecasting in residential buildings. The model is based on Bayesian network (BN) framework which is able to discover dependency relations between contributing variables. Thus, we can relax the assumptions that are often made in traditional forecasting models. Moreover, we are able to efficiently capture the uncertainties in input variables and quantify their effect on the system output. We test our proposed approach to the data provided by Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) which has been collected through a pilot Smart Grid project. We examine the performance of our model in a multiscale setting by considering various temporal (i.e., 15 min, hourly intervals) and spatial (i.e., all households in a region, each household) resolutions for analyzing data. Demand forecasting at the individual households’ levels is a first step toward designing personalized and targeted policies for each customer. While this is a widely studied topic in digital marketing, few researches have been done in the energy sector. The results indicate that Bayesian networks can be efficiently used for probabilistic energy modeling in residential buildings by discovering the dependencies between variables."

In the European Union (EU), the production, trade and marketing of GM products is strictly regulated, but the situation is becoming more complex due to the increasing number and complexity of GM crops, and asynchronic approval procedures with the major GM crop producing countries. Importers and traders are obliged to assess their respective supply chains for the potential presence of authorised and unauthorised GM organisms (GMOs), where wrong decisions may lead to substantial economic losses. This article presents a decision support system SIGMO aimed at guiding producers and traders with the assessment of the likelihood that their products may comprise authorised or unauthorised GM materials. The assessment is based on traceability data about the product (nature and origin of the raw materials, transportation aspects), as well as analytical results of the presence of GMOs in the final product or its ingredients. The approach uses a combination of data-driven and model-driven decision support. SIGMO is composed of (1) a data base providing data about GMO crop species produced and approved in counties worldwide, (2) a multi-attribute model for the assessment of GMO presence in food/feed products, and (3) an on-line user interface. SIGMO helps producers and traders to better comply to valid EU GMO regulations and to better control their products and supply chains in terms of the unintended presence of (unauthorised) GMOs in a cost-effective way."
84964444611,A profit-driven Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with applications to fraud detection and direct marketing,Zakaryazad A.,Neurocomputing,2016-12-15,10.1016/j.neucom.2015.10.042,103,Özyeğin Üniversitesi,Article,"© 2015 Elsevier B.V.The rapid growth in data capture and computational power has led to an increasing focus on data-driven research. So far, most of the research is focused on predictive modeling using statistical optimization, while profit maximization has been given less priority. It is exactly this gap that will be addressed in this study by taking a profit-driven approach to develop a profit-driven Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification technique. In order to do this, we have first introduced an ANN model with a new penalty function which gives variable penalties to the misclassification of instances considering their individual importance (profit of correctly classification and/or cost of misclassification) and then we have considered maximizing the total net profit. In order to generate individual penalties, we have modified the sum of squared errors (SSE) function by changing its values with respect to profit of each instance. We have implemented different versions of ANN of which five of them are new ones contributed in this study and two benchmarks from relevant literature. We appraise the effectiveness of the proposed models on two real-life data sets from fraud detection and a University of California Irvine (UCI) repository data set about bank direct marketing. For the comparison, we have considered both statistical and profit-driven performance metrics. Empirical results revealed that, although in most cases the statistical performance of new models are not better than previous ones, they turn out to be better when profit is the concern."

Mack Robinson College of Business,Article,"© 2016 University of Minnesota. All rights reserved.Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance."

Both regulatory science and clinical practice rely on best available scientific data to guide decision-making. However, changes in clinical practice may be driven by numerous other factors such as cost. In this review, we reexamine noteworthy examples where pharmacogenetic testing information was added to drug labeling to explore how the available evidence, potential public health impact, and predictive utility of each pharmacogenetic biomarker impacts clinical uptake. Summary:. Advances in the field of pharmacogenetics have led to new discoveries about the genetic basis for variability in drug response. The Food and Drug Administration recognizes the value of pharmacogenetic testing strategies and has been proactive about incorporating pharmaco-genetic information into the labeling of both new drugs and drugs already on the market. Although some examples have readily translated to routine clinical practice, clinical uptake of genetic testing for many drugs has been limited. Conclusion:. Both regulatory science and clinical practice rely on data-driven approaches to guide decision making; however, additional factors are also important in clinical practice that do not impact regulatory decision making, and these considerations may result in heterogeneity in clinical uptake of pharmacogenetic testing."
84956856657,Optimization in online content recommendation services: Beyond click-through rates,Besbes O.,Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,2016-12-01,10.1287/msom.2015.0548,33,Columbia University,Article,"© 2016 INFORMS.Anew class of online services allows Internet media sites to direct users from articles they are currently reading to other content they may be interested in. This process creates a ""browsing path"" along which there is potential for repeated interaction between the user and the provider, giving rise to a dynamic optimization problem. A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some lookahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no lookahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice. The documented improvement highlights the importance and the practicality of efficiently incorporating the future path of users in real time."
85007569943,A Quantitative Approach for Benefit-Risk Assessment Using Stochastic Multi-Criteria Discriminatory Method,Wang Y.,Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research,2016-10-01,10.1080/19466315.2016.1202135,4,Food and Drug Administration,Article,"© 2016 American Statistical Association.Benefit-risk (BR) assessment is important to ensure safety and effectiveness of medical projects in clinical development and post marketing surveillance. The evaluation of the balance between benefits and risks of a drug is fundamental to all stakeholders involved in the development, registration, and use of drugs. Many quantitative approaches have been developed that may draw together data from different sources to present them in ways that can aid decision-making. Among these quantitative approaches, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is one of the most useful approaches, since it provides a framework for systematic and replicable analyses of complex decision problems involving value tradeoffs. In most real-life situations, decision makers are not able to get exact preference information (weights). To overcome this limitation of MCDA, a method called stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) was proposed as a quantitative approach to BR assessment in drug development. The chief advantage of SMAA over most other MCDA methodologies is that it can be used with limited or no preference information and a data-driven approach can be used to obtain the inherent weighting among multicriteria. In this article, we propose the stochastic multicriteria discriminatory method (SMDM) that is based on the SMAA method with a focus on providing straightforward and informative assistance to decision making. We use SMDM to derive probability of better treatment, probability of significantly better treatment and the expected p-values of the evaluation results, on the basis of limited partial weight information or no weight information at all."

Populations are segmented into meaningful groups that share similar attitudes and preferences. This segmentation provides valuable information about how policy options, such as pricing measures or advertising campaigns, should be designed and promoted in order to successfully target different user groups. In this paper, we aim to bridge between psychological, social marketing and ICT research in the field of transportation. We explore how attitude based segments are reflected in high resolution mobility behaviour data, crowdsourced via mobile phones. We use support vector machines to map eight attitudinal segments, as defined under the European project SEGMENT, to the n dimensional space defined by crowdsourced data. The success rate of the proposed approach is 98.9%. This demonstrates the applicability of the method as a way to automatically map attitudinal segments to a wider population based on observed mobility data instead of using explicit attitudinal surveys. In addition, the proposed approach can facilitate the delivery of personalised target messages to individuals (e.g. via smartphones) or at target locations where users, belonging to specific segment, are located at specific time windows since the data includes the time-space indications."

The present study used an online survey to investigate the emotional associations that people have with recalled meals: 'memorable' (MM) and 'routine' evening (RM). Heterogeneity in the studied consumer population (UK adults, n = 576 and 571, respectively) was accounted for using a data-driven approach to establish emotion-based segments. Two groups of people were identified with very different emotional response patterns to recalled meals. For 'memorable' and 'routine' meals the majority of people (Cluster 1) held strong positive and weak negative emotional associations. In Cluster 2, positive emotions remained more strongly associated than negative emotions, but much less so. In accordance with findings based on other response variables (e.g., preference, attitudes), psychographic variables accounted better for the heterogeneity found in the emotion associations than socio-demographic variables. Participants' level of meal engagement and difficulty in describing feelings (DDF scale) were the two most important predictors of cluster membership."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a content analysis of 54 DTC and DTP print prescription drug advertisements (published between 1997 and 2014) with comparative claims. Findings: Efficacy-based comparisons appeared in 64 per cent of advertisements, and attribute-based comparisons appeared in 37 per cent of advertisements. Most advertisements made direct (vs indirect) references to competitors (85 per cent), compared the advertised drug to a single (vs multiple) competitor (78 per cent), focused exclusively on one type of comparison claim (i.e. efficacy-, risk- or attribute-based) (70 per cent) and did not contain data-driven visual aids (82 per cent). Some differences between DTC and DTP advertisements emerged. More DTP than DTC advertisements included data-driven visual aids (82 per cent vs 0 per cent, respectively), included numerical data (88 per cent vs 53 per cent) and conveyed statistical significance (52 per cent vs 12 per cent). Research limitations/implications: The study used a convenience sample rather than a random sample of advertisements; thus, the findings might not be generalizable to all pharmaceutical DTC and DTP advertisements. Examining the tactics that advertisers use to educate and influence consumers and physicians sets the foundation for future studies that examine the effects of their exposure to comparative claims. Suggestions for future research are discussed. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine and statistically compare the comparative advertising tactics used in both consumer and physician prescription drug advertisements."

Through qualitative content analysis of 205 reviews from 41 food establishments in Hawaii, we found 8 main categories of expressions of deliciousness. These eight main categories created by both concept-driven and data-driven strategies are Sense, Culinary Affair, Matter of Heart, Health, Testimonial and Endorsement, Personal Signature, Consumer, and Restaurant. Each main category was further subcategorized. This meaningful categorization might contribute to healthier eating by helping policy makers and food companies craft effective strategies for healthy eating schemes, healthy menu items, or healthy food products. Marketers of any food product can also increase their market share by utilizing these categories, subcategories, and their underlying concepts in the planning stage. Detailed examples of nudging and social marketing campaigns inspired by our findings were provided. Moreover, social network sites can better serve health conscious and hedonic consumers by personalization through improved algorithms inspired by these categories."

Maintaining brands and bringing them back to life in the market has received much less interest than their creation. Moreover, the existing literature is dominated by the marketing management paradigm where the company’s role is emphasized. This paper addresses the phenomenon of brand revitalization from a sociocultural perspective and examines the role of consumer collectives in the process. Design/methodology/approach: Using a data-driven approach, the study builds on the case of a consumer brand of footwear that has risen to unprecedented popularity without traditional marketing campaigns. Data were generated using an inductive theory building approach utilizing multiple methods, including interviews, participant observation and cultural materials. Findings: The paper presents a conceptual model of cultural brand revitalization that has four stages: sleeping brand, spontaneous appropriation, diffusion and convergence. Practical implications: Implications for companies in consumer markets are discussed, suggesting ways to facilitate the process of sociocultural brand revitalization. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature first by offering a sociocultural brand revitalization scenario that highlights the interplay between the actions of consumers and the company, second, by examining the interaction between the symbolic meanings associated with the brand and the practices used by consumers and, third, by offering insights into the relevance of national identity in creating brand meaning."

They include planning, academic entrepreneurship, data-driven decision making, revenue generation, creating professional and academic pathways for learners, curriculum development, and business development and marketing. This is followed by a set of pragmatic considerations that higher education administrators and leaders may consider in their professional practices. The considerations provide a framework for interrogating leadership assumptions and responsibilities, a framework that can be applied to analyze additional responsibilities as they emerge in relation to the assumptions that accompany them. The considerations pose intended and unintended possibilities for leaders to use to inform decision making, maintain principled leadership practices, and to challenge unexamined beliefs and values."

Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.ABSTRACT: Biosimilars are biological medicinal products that contain a version of the active substance of an already authorised original biological medicinal product (the innovator or reference product). The first approved biosimilar medicines were small proteins, and more recently biosimilar versions of innovator monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs have entered development as patents on these more complex proteins expire. In September 2013, the first biosimilar mAb, infliximab, was authorised in Europe. In March 2015, the first biosimilar (Zarxio™, filgrastim-sndz, Sandoz) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration; however, to date no mAb biosimilars have been approved in the US. There are currently major differences between how biosimilars are regulated in different parts of the world, leading to substantial variability in the amount of in vivo nonclinical toxicity testing required to support clinical development and marketing of biosimilars. There are approximately 30 national and international guidelines on biosimilar development and this number is growing. The European Union's guidance describes an approach that enables biosimilars to enter clinical trials based on robust in vitro data alone; in contrast, the World Health Organization's guidance is interpreted globally to mean in vivo toxicity studies are mandatory. We reviewed our own experience working in the global regulatory environment, surveyed current practice, determined drivers for nonclinical in vivo studies with biosimilar mAbs and shared data on practice and study design for 25 marketed and as yet unmarketed biosimilar mAbs that have been in development in the past 5y. These data showed a variety of nonclinical in vivo approaches, and also demonstrated the practical challenges faced in obtaining regulatory approval for clinical trials based on in vitro data alone. The majority of reasons for carrying out nonclinical in vivo studies were not based on scientific rationale, and therefore the authors have made recommendations for a data-driven approach to the toxicological assessment of mAb biosimilars that minimises unnecessary use of animals and can be used across all regions of the world."
84991798406,"A case study: Analyzing city vitality with four pillars of activity - Live, work, shop, and play",Griffin M.,Big Data,2016-03-01,10.1089/big.2015.0043,7,,Article,"© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.This case study evaluates and tracks vitality of a city (Seattle), based on a data-driven approach, using strategic, robust, and sustainable metrics. This case study was collaboratively conducted by the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA) and CDO Analytics teams. The DSA is a nonprofit organization focused on making the city of Seattle and its Downtown a healthy and vibrant place to Live, Work, Shop, and Play. DSA primarily operates through public policy advocacy, community and business development, and marketing. In 2010, the organization turned to CDO Analytics (cdoanalytics.org) to develop a process that can guide and strategically focus DSA efforts and resources for maximal benefit to the city of Seattle and its Downtown. CDO Analytics was asked to develop clear, easily understood, and robust metrics for a baseline evaluation of the health of the city, as well as for ongoing monitoring and comparisons of the vitality, sustainability, and growth. The DSA and CDO Analytics teams strategized on how to effectively assess and track the vitality of Seattle and its Downtown. The two teams filtered a variety of data sources, and evaluated the veracity of multiple diverse metrics. This iterative process resulted in the development of a small number of strategic, simple, reliable, and sustainable metrics across four pillars of activity: Live, Work, Shop, and Play. Data during the 5 years before 2010 were used for the development of the metrics and model and its training, and data during the 5 years from 2010 and on were used for testing and validation. This work enabled DSA to routinely track these strategic metrics, use them to monitor the vitality of Downtown Seattle, prioritize improvements, and identify new value-added programs. As a result, the four-pillar approach became an integral part of the data-driven decision-making and execution of the Seattle community's improvement activities. The approach described in this case study is actionable, robust, inexpensive, and easy to adopt and sustain. It can be applied to cities, districts, counties, regions, states, or countries, enabling cross-comparisons and improvements of vitality, sustainability, and growth."

84945466136,A novel approach to conduct the importance-satisfaction analysis for acquiring typical user groups in business-intelligence systems,Wang C.H.,Computers in Human Behavior,2016-01-01,10.1016/j.chb.2015.08.014,27,National Chiao Tung University,Article,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Business intelligence (BI) is a powerful tool to conduct causality analysis and corporate diagnoses since it provides a data-driven approach to link firms' strategic goals into tactical policies and operational actions. Specifically, BI consists of a series of architectures and techniques like database, data warehousing, and data mining that transform raw data into useful information to provide decision supports. In reality, typical BI user groups involve financial analysts, marketing planners, general managers, field staffs, upstream suppliers, and downstream customers. Inspired by the concept of STP (segmentation-target-positioning) and product family design, BI systems need to be customized to satisfy diverse user groups and tailored to a firm for solving complicated but specific business problems. Consequently, a novel framework is proposed to fulfill the following goals: (1) incorporating user preferences to identify key design features that best fit BI's main segments for achieving customer acquisition, (2) transforming user perceptions into quantitative degrees of satisfaction for accomplishing customer retention, and (3) conducting the importance-satisfaction analysis to generate managerial insights for developing next-generation BI systems."

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, 'big data,' and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges."

Medical travel is recognized as a growing global market and is an important subject of inquiry for US academic medical centers, hospitals and policy makers. Few data-driven studies exist to shed light on efficient and effective strategies for attracting international medical travelers. Design/methodology/approach – This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of the 194 member and/or observer countries of the United Nations. Data for medical traveler volume into the USA between 2008 and 2010 were obtained from the USA Department of Commerce, Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, Survey of International Air Travelers. Data on country-level factors were collected from publicly available databases, including the United Nations, World Bank and World Health Organization. Linear regression models with a negative binomial distribution and log link function were fit to test the association between each independent variable and the number of inbound medical travelers to the USA. Findings – Seven of the 24 country-level factors were significantly associated with the number of outbound medical travelers to the USA These factors included imports as a per cent of gross domestic product, trade in services as a per cent of gross domestic product, per cent of population living in urbanareas, life expectancy, childhood mortality, incidence of tuberculosis and prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus. Practical implications – Results of this model provide evidence for a data-driven approach to strategic outreach and business development for hospitals and policy makers for attracting international patients to the USA for medical care. Originality/value – The model developed in this paper can assist US hospitals in promoting their services to international patients as well as national efforts in identifying “high potential” medical travel markets. Other countries could also adapt this methodology for targeting the international patient market."

Consequently, these organisations need to be more proactive than ever. The increased level of communications between individuals and organisations today, heightens the need for investigating the drivers of charitable giving and understanding the various consumer groups, or donor segments, within a population. It is contended that trust' is the cornerstone of the not-for-profit sector's survival, making it an inevitable topic for research in this context. It has become imperative for charities and not-for-profit organisations to adopt for-profit's research, marketing and targeting strategies. This study provides the not-for-profit sector with an easily-interpretable segmentation method based on a novel unsupervised clustering technique (MST-kNN) followed by a feature saliency method (the CM1 score). A sample of 1,562 respondents from a survey conducted by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission is analysed to reveal donor segments. Each cluster's most salient features are identified using the CM1 score. Furthermore, symbolic regression modelling is employed to find cluster-specific models to predict low' or high' involvement in clusters. The MST-kNN method found seven clusters. Based on their salient features they were labelled as: the non-institutionalist charities supporters', the resource allocation critics', the information-seeking financial sceptics', the non-questioning charity supporters', the non-trusting sceptics', the charity management believers' and the institutionalist charity believers'. Each cluster exhibits their own characteristics as well as different drivers of involvement'. The method in this study provides the not-for-profit sector with a guideline for clustering, segmenting, understanding and potentially targeting their donor base better. If charities and not-for-profit organisations adopt these strategies, they will be more successful in today's competitive environment."

These techniques can also be applied to food and nutrition, which must be studied to design healthy diets. Using nutritional information from over 1,000 raw foods, we systematically evaluated the nutrient composition of each food in regards to satisfying daily nutritional requirements. The nutrient balance of a food was quantified and termed nutritional fitness; this measure was based on the food's frequency of occurrence in nutritionally adequate food combinations. Nutritional fitness offers a way to prioritize recommendable foods within a global network of foods, in which foods are connected based on the similarities of their nutrient compositions. We identified a number of key nutrients, such as choline and α-linolenic acid, whose levels in foods can critically affect the nutritional fitness of the foods. Analogously, pairs of nutrients can have the same effect. In fact, two nutrients can synergistically affect the nutritional fitness, although the individual nutrients alone may not have an impact. This result, involving the tendency among nutrients to exhibit correlations in their abundances across foods, implies a hidden layer of complexity when exploring for foods whose balance of nutrients within pairs holistically helps meet nutritional requirements. Interestingly, foods with high nutritional fitness successfully maintain this nutrient balance. This effect expands our scope to a diverse repertoire of nutrient-nutrient correlations, which are integrated under a common network framework that yields unexpected yet coherent associations between nutrients. Our nutrientprofiling approach combined with a network-based analysis provides a more unbiased, global view of the relationships between foods and nutrients, and can be extended towards nutritional policies, food marketing, and personalized nutrition."

However the development of Big Data, even in the abstract, provides researchers with the opportunity to rethink our approach to gathering and applying knowledge. Many countries, companies and universities are investing millions of dollars in the development of Big Data. Some believe this era of data driven computational social science has the same potential as the emergence of cognitive science in the 1960s and should not be left to private companies or government agencies. Given the entrance of Big Data techniques to companies and the university setting, it is our role, as consumer researchers, to identify issues that are relevant to our field and to suggest a consumer research method adapted to Big Data. The first section of this article addresses ethical and epistemic issues to consider when conducting marketing research with Big Data. The second section suggests the use of abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers’ digital traces and make new theories emerge. Finally, we present the archetype-based analysis as an example of what researchers can do with Big Data when they adopt abductive, inductive and deductive approaches in the research process."

However, pharmaceutical companies have been slow to recognize and embrace the significant potential these programs offer in terms of enhancing trust with health care professionals and patients, and for providing a mechanism for bringing products to the market that might not otherwise have been approved. Pitfalls of the current drug development process include risk minimization programs that are not data driven; missed opportunities to incorporate pragmatic methods and market-based insights, outmoded tools and data sources, lack of rapid evaluative learning to support timely adaption, lack of systematic approaches for patient engagement, and questions on staffing and organizational infrastructure. We propose better integration of risk minimization with clinical drug development and commercialization work streams throughout the product lifecycle. We articulate a vision and propose broad adoption of organizational models for incorporating risk minimization expertise into the drug development process. Three organizational models are discussed and compared: outsource/external vendor, embedded risk management specialist model, and Center of Excellence."

In order to better understand the decision to pursue sales education, more than 500 undergraduate business students at a large Midwestern university participated in a survey that examined the factors influencing their decision to pursue sales education within a business major. The findings indicate that the choice of sales education is driven by students’ appreciation for creativity and people skills and their own interests and abilities, but the students’ school advisors (either college or high school) have significant influence as well. In today’s data-driven world, sales jobs depend on the use of analytical and intensively quantitative skills, yet our results indicate that sales students lack appreciation and enjoyment of the quantitative aspects of their major and potential career path."

Current research in this area is mostly hypothesis-driven and much debate about the concept of Customer Engagement and its related constructs remains existent in the literature. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel methodology for reverse engineering a consumer behavior model for online customer engagement, based on a computational and data-driven perspective. This methodology could be generalized and prove useful for future research in the fields of consumer behaviors using questionnaire data or studies investigating other types of human behaviors. The method we propose contains five main stages; symbolic regression analysis, graph building, community detection, evaluation of results and finally, investigation of directed cycles and common feedback loops. The 'communities' of questionnaire items that emerge from our community detection method form possible 'functional constructs' inferred from data rather than assumed from literature and theory. Our results show consistent partitioning of questionnaire items into such 'functional constructs' suggesting the method proposed here could be adopted as a new data-driven way of human behavior modeling. © 2014 de Vries et al."

The paper provides the first systematic analysis of the implications of the virtual world market players Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay/PayPal, and Amazon on traditional retailers' business. We use case study research to identify the elements that are required for and suitable to such a strategy. In a second step, we use design science in order to identify and develop the necessary value creation roles, their activities, and the value flows between them. The paper provides two major outcomes: (1) a set of 12 building blocks for generating and applying customer data for traditional retailers adding mobile services and (2) a role-based reference model for the value network of the future retail customer interface and marketing (CIM). The reference model is validated with expert interviews. As an exemplary application of the model, we show two extreme scenarios with strong and weak retailer market positions. As an additional contribution to practice, we present a further introspective analysis of the value network's key new role - that of mobile customer relationship management service provider - and propose a corresponding functional component architecture that fulfills the information technology requirements for the role's complex functionality. © 2014 M.E.

Currently, to understand the retail market means to search for local patterns at the micro level, involving the segmentation, separation and profiling of diverse groups of consumers. In other contexts, however, markets are modelled as complex systems. Such strategy is able to uncover emerging regularities and patterns that make markets more predictable, e.g. enabling to predict how much a country’s GDP will grow. Rather than isolate actors in homogeneous groups, this strategy requires to consider the system as a whole, as the emerging pattern can be detected only as a result of the interaction between its self-organizing parts. This assumption holds also in the retail market: each customer can be seen as an independent unit maximizing its own utility function. As a consequence, the global behaviour of the retail market naturally emerges, enabling a novel description of its properties, complementary to the local pattern approach. Such task demands for a data-driven empirical framework. In this paper, we analyse a unique transaction database, recording the micro-purchases of a million customers observed for several years in the stores of a national supermarket chain. We show the emergence of the fundamental pattern of this complex system, connecting the products’ volumes of sales with the customers’ volumes of purchases. This pattern has a number of applications. We provide three of them. By enabling us to evaluate the sophistication of needs that a customer has and a product satisfies, this pattern has been applied to the task of uncovering the hierarchy of needs of the customers, providing a hint about what is the next product a customer could be interested in buying and predicting in which shop she is likely to go to buy it."

Large collections of individual case reports remain the primary source of information and require effective analytics to guide clinical assessors towards likely drug safety signals. Disproportionality analysis is based solely on aggregate numbers of reports and naively disregards report quality and content. However, these latter features are the very fundament of the ensuing clinical assessment. Objective: Our objective was to develop and evaluate a data-driven screening algorithm for emerging drug safety signals that accounts for report quality and content. Methods: vigiRank is a predictive model for emerging safety signals, here implemented with shrinkage logistic regression to identify predictive variables and estimate their respective contributions. The variables considered for inclusion capture different aspects of strength of evidence, including quality and clinical content of individual reports, as well as trends in time and geographic spread. A reference set of 264 positive controls (historical safety signals from 2003 to 2007) and 5,280 negative controls (pairs of drugs and adverse events not listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics of that drug in 2012) was used for model fitting and evaluation; the latter used fivefold cross-validation to protect against over-fitting. All analyses were performed on a reconstructed version of VigiBase® as of 31 December 2004, at around which time most safety signals in our reference set were emerging. Results: The following aspects of strength of evidence were selected for inclusion into vigiRank: the numbers of informative and recent reports, respectively; disproportional reporting; the number of reports with free-text descriptions of the case; and the geographic spread of reporting. vigiRank offered a statistically significant improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) over screening based on the Information Component (IC) and raw numbers of reports, respectively (0.775 vs. 0.736 and 0.707, cross-validated). Conclusions: Accounting for multiple aspects of strength of evidence has clear conceptual and empirical advantages over disproportionality analysis. vigiRank is a first-of-its-kind predictive model to factor in report quality and content in first-pass screening to better meet tomorrow's post-marketing drug safety surveillance needs. © 2014 The Author(s)."

Over 700,000 apps are available for immediate download from app markets (e.g., App Store and Google Play). These marketplaces are a significant disruptive change in the way content is created and consumed. On the supply side, they provide content creators direct, instantaneous, and popular distribution systems where they can implement their own marketing and pricing policies, cutting out middlemen. Taking a combined data-driven and structural analysis approach, this paper focuses on the relationship between pricing decisions and marketplace visibility. Our aim is to empower content creators by offering strategic guidance on how to leverage the marketplaces' exibility. Specifically, the market platforms feature ""top-ranked"" charts that list apps by number of downloads. A high position in these charts is followed by a remarkable boost in demand, according to industry sources. We call the effect of top-rank position on future sales an indirect effect. First, we postulate a reduced form model to estimate the magnitude of this indirect effect. Our results show that it is statistically significant and substantial. Second, we study app pricing decisions in a model that incorporates our earlier findings. Surprisingly, we find that accounting for the indirect effect may give rise to optimal price cycles, where the seller alternates between a high price to boost revenue and a low one to enhance visibility. We find evidence supporting this pricing behavior in practice."

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research was conducted, with a follow-on quantitative pre-test. A subsequent, larger-scale quantitative survey resulted in a total of 128 responses, 124 useable. A regression analysis was conducted using the factor scores of the six organizational dimensions as independent variables and overall data quality as the dependent variable. Findings: The findings show that overcoming poor IMC data quality requires a corporate culture that reduces cross-functional and departmental divides. The authors also support the idea that horizontally organized learning organizations not only have superior IMC data, but they also achieve higher rates of return on their cross-platform IMC efforts. Research limitations/implications: The research has limitations in terms of substantive generalizability, since it focuses on one industry within the USA. Future research can expand to other industries and expand to a global setting in order to replicate these findings. Practical implications: Most improvement seems to be needed in the area of sharing customer data. The findings provide a signal to marketing organizations that want to connect with their customers that data quality must be a strategic priority, with appropriate processes in place to manage data at every touch point.

This is particularly the case in business-to-business marketing, where the firm's extended working relationship with its customers is frequently crucial for the maintenance of a healthy business. However, in many instances management has treated CRM data as highly specific to its client relationships and has therefore neglected to analyze this information across market segments, customer categories, and customer-firm relationship forms in order to draw meaningful conclusions for driving business decisions.The authors present a method for effectively classifying CRM information in ways that may help guide management decisions. This can lead to an improved understanding of the in-forming process in the firm's dealings with its clients, the directionality of customer-firm decision-making, the key decision drivers across deals, and the historical record of the firm's relationship with its customers. The end result will be an improved use of valuable historical information for establishing competitive strategies and the related programs and policies for retaining and growing the firm's customer base and other elements of the firm's value delivery network. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Big data is notable not only because of its size, but also because of the complexity caused by its relationality to other data. In the past, owing to the limited possibilities of accessing big data, few data sources were available to allow researchers to develop advanced data-driven applications, such as monitoring of emerging real-world events. In fact, social media is greatly impacting the growth of big data; and big data is providing enterprises with the data to help them understand how to better detect marketing demands. Microblogging is a social network service capable of aggregating messages to explore facts and unknown knowledge. Nowadays, people often attempt to search for trending news and hot topics in real time from microblogging messages to satisfy their information needs. Under such a circumstance, a real demand is to find a way to allow users to organize a large number of microblogging messages into understandable events. In this work, we attempt to tackle such challenges by developing an online text-stream clustering approach using a modified density-based clustering model with collected microblogging big data. The system kernel combines three technical components, including a dynamic term weighting scheme, a neighbourhood generation algorithm and an online density-based clustering technique. After acquiring detected event topics by the system, our system provides functions for recommending top-priority event information to assist people to effectively organize emerging event data through the developed topic ranking algorithm. © 2013 The Author(s)."

Three main results emerge from our simulations. First, failure to consider homophily creates significant overestimation of the effectiveness of seeding strategies, casting doubt on conclusions drawn by simulation studies that do not model homophily. Second, seeding is constrained by the small fraction of potential influencers that exist in the network. We find that seeding more than 0.2% of the population is wasteful because the gain from their adoption is lower than the gain from their natural adoption (without seeding). Third, seeding is more effective in the presence of greater social influence. Stronger peer influence creates a greater than additive effect when combined with seeding. Our findings call into question some conventional wisdom about these strategies and suggest that their overall effectiveness may be overestimated. © 2013, Cambridge University Press.

Campaigns use statistical tools for deciding whom to target (""microtargeting""). In this paper we describe a nonpartisan campaign that aims at increasing overall turnout using the example of the 2004 US presidential election. Based on a real data set of 19,634 eligible voters from Ohio, we introduce a modern statistical framework well suited for carrying out the main tasks of voter targeting in a single sweep: predicting an individual's turnout (or support) likelihood for a particular cause, party or candidate as well as data-driven voter segmentation. Our framework, which we refer to as LORET (for LOgistic REgression Trees), contains standard methods such as logistic regression and classification trees as special cases and allows for a synthesis of both techniques. For our case study, we explore various LORET models with different regressors in the logistic model components and different partitioning variables in the tree components; we analyze them in terms of their predictive accuracy and compare the effect of using the full set of available variables against using only a limited amount of information. We find that augmenting a standard set of variables (such as age and voting history) with additional predictor variables (such as the household composition in terms of party affiliation) clearly improves predictive accuracy. We also find that LORET models based on tree induction beat the unpartitioned models. Furthermore, we illustrate how voter segmentation arises from our framework and discuss the resulting profiles from a targeting point of view. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013."

During the development of drug products, it is important to understand the stability of not only the active pharmaceutical ingredient but also the color and appearance of the tablet or capsule. Currently, the most common method to ensure color stability is to conduct a visual test throughout a stability study. This visual test is subjective and can be expensive, especially if there is a failure late in development or after marketing approval. This work describes a series of studies using accelerated conditions (i.e., heat, humidity, and light) and logistic regression analyses that have been developed to determine the relative stability ranking of multiple color coatings early in development to provide an increased probability of technical success on long-term stability studies and to avoid coatings whose visual appearance may change over time. Once this relative stability ranking has been established, the stability advantages can be assessed versus any manufacturing/processing liabilities of the selected coating in order to make a data-driven decision around coating selection. This work reviews the basic fundamentals of colorimetry, followed by the description of a consistent experimental approach to correlate a visual rating with an instrumental measurement (e.g., dE from a colorimeter) to remove the subjectivity from the assessment. This approach represents a novel strategy for establishing a probabilized correlation between the quantitative instrumental color measurement and the visual rating of the same color change. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association."

The dominant view of pricing strategy is that pricing goals, objectives, and strategies should be formulated a priori, and should be consistent with marketing and corporate strategies - deliberate pricing strategy. This chapter argues that firms need to develop new strategic pricing skills that lead to more improvisational, innovative, or adaptive pricing strategies. I call this type of price strategy-making emergent pricing strategy. Innovative pricing strategies that the organization judges, or senses to be effective, are repeated, shared, expanded, and refined into successful pricing patterns that, over time and across situations, become pricing strategy. Thus, rather than specifically designing pricing strategy to achieve a goal, here the organization acts upon a price innovation that seems to make sense for this customer, this market segment, this setting, and this situation, then interprets the outcomes, signals, and reactions that seem to flow from the pricing action, and shares and encourages adoption and adaption by others in the organization. Emergent pricing strategy is particularly useful in unstable, turbulent, and complex product and market environments in which price-sensitive buyers wield significant power and influence. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Stern School of Business,Article,"Marketing researchers have become increasingly interested in spatial datasets. A main challenge of analyzing spatial data is that researchers must a priori choose the size and make-up of the areal units, hence the resolution of the analysis. Analyzing the data at a resolution that is too high may mask ""macro"" patterns, while analyzing the data at a resolution that is too low may result in aggregation bias. Thus, ideally marketing researchers would want a ""data-driven"" method to determine the ""optimal"" resolution of analysis, and at the same time automatically explore the same dataset under different resolutions, to obtain a full set of empirical insights to help with managerial decision making. In this paper, we propose a new approach for multi-resolution spatial analysis that is based on Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate our method using two recentmarketing datasets from published studies: (i) the Netgrocer spatial sales data in Bell and Song (Quantitative Marketing and Economics 5:361-400, 2007), and (ii) the Pathtracker® data in Hui et al. (Marketing Science 28:566-572, 2009b; Journal of Consumer Research 36:478-493, 2009c) that track shoppers' in-store movements. In both cases, our method allows researchers to not only automatically select the resolution of the analysis, but also analyze the data under different resolutions to understand the variation in insights and robustness to the level of aggregation. © The Author(s) 2012."

To identify the segmentation power of personal traits, this analysis is complemented with a multiple discriminant analysis as well as a number of contingency tests to identify differences between the segments. We identified four clearly definable segments, which differ in terms of the psychographic traits of the segment members but also in terms of some sociodemographic characteristics as well as travel profiles. Despite a growing body of work on classical market segmentation, there is a growing but still limited number of works on potentialities of psychographic approaches relating to a traveler's traits and/or personality as a segmentation basis in tourism. © 2012 Cognizant Comm.

PEPFAR's early focus was on scaling-up information, education, and communication programs that included messaging on abstinence for youth and faithfulness primarily through nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organizations. Additional activities included condom promotion, distribution, and social marketing. In epidemics concentrated within key populations, PEPFAR's prevention efforts focused on a minimum package of services including outreach, information, education, and communication programs, STI treatment (where appropriate), and condom promotion and distribution. As more epidemiological data became available and with experience gleaned in these early efforts, the need for tailored and flexible approaches became evident. The next iteration of prevention efforts still emphasized behavioral interventions, but incorporated a sharper focus on key epidemic drivers, especially multiple partners; a data-driven emphasis on high transmission areas and populations, including prevention with people living with HIV; and a more strategic and coordinated approach at the national level. Recently, the paradigm for prevention efforts has shifted yet again. Evidence that biomedical interventions such as male circumcision, treatment for prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission, and treatment itself could lead to declines in incidence has refocused PEPFAR's prevention portfolio. New guidance on sexually transmitted HIV focuses on combination prevention, emphasizing biomedical, behavioral and structural approaches. Landmark speeches by the President and the Secretary of State and new ambitious targets for PEPFAR point toward a new goal: an AIDS-free generation.

84864135851,Web search queries can predict stock market volumes,Bordino I.,PLoS ONE,2012-07-19,10.1371/journal.pone.0040014,160,Yahoo Research Barcelona,Article,"We live in a computerized and networked society where many of our actions leave a digital trace and affect other people's actions. This has lead to the emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users. These findings contribute to the debate on the identification of early warnings of financial systemic risk, based on the activity of users of the www. © 2012 Bordino et al."

The purpose of this study is to develop a generally applicable and reliable data-driven benefit-risk assessment method, where two or more drugs/doses can be compared. Our aim is to formulate an approach that is simple to apply, allows direct comparison of different types of risks and benefits, and is tailored for application in different disease areas both during clinical development and in the marketing approval phase. The proposed benefit-risk assessment method involves eight successive steps: (1) establishment of the decision context, (2) identification of benefit and risk criteria, (3) weighting, (4) scoring, (5) evaluation of uncertainty, (6) calculation of weighted scores, (7) visualization, and (8) discussion and formulation of an overall conclusion. To reduce the impact of subjective judgements, scores are assigned to each criterion on the basis of objective information (data) wherever possible. The proposed benefit-risk evaluation approach offers comprehensive, data-driven assessments that can facilitate decision processes. It employs descriptive statistical methods to highlight the clinically significant differences between drugs in clinical trials. The approach can be used in single as well as in multiple trials and provides clear diagrams as the basis for presentation and discussion of the results. © 2012 The Authors Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology © 2012 Nordic Pharmacological Society."

Representative, empirical data on consumer characteristics; motivations and expectations for testing; intended uses for the information; understanding of results; and behavioral and psychological reactions to the tests are absent. Although the 2010 American Society of Human Genetics white paper clarifies the number and some general characteristics of companies marketing and selling DNA ancestry tests, additional data about the industry's practices have been unavailable. Methods: To promote a data-driven discussion of the DNA ancestry testing industry, we conducted a systematic investigation to identify companies selling DNA ancestry tests and conducted an empirical study of the industry's practices using data collected from each company's website. Results: Here, we present a wealth of data, including an updated directory of companies, marketing slogans, product types and names, range of prices, diversity of reporting and representing results, noted benefits and limitations of testing, and a host of website practices. Conclusion: The tremendous diversity of tests, information, and practices of companies in the DNA ancestry sector should be considered when policies for best practice guidelines or regulatory oversight are being developed. ©American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics."

The purpose of this article is to promote an analogous development in business research. Specifically, we focus on network analysis: given the key constructs in a business research domain, we introduce a data-driven protocol applicable to business survey data to (a) discover the web of influence directionalities among the key constructs and therein identify the critical constructs, and to (b) determine the relative contributions of the constructs in predicting the levels of the critical constructs. In (a), we build a directed connectivity graph by (i) using a state of the art statistical technique to perform variable selection, (ii) integrating the variable selection results to form the directed connectivity graph, and (iii) employing graph-theoretical concepts and a graph clustering technique to interpret the resulting network topology in a multi-resolution manner. In (b), based on the directed connectivity graph, multiple linear regression is performed to quantify relations between the critical and other constructs. As a case study, the protocol is applied to analyze opinion leading and seeking behaviors in online market communications environments. The directed connectivity relations revealed provide new ways of visualizing the web of influence directionalities among the constructs of interest, suggest new research directions to pursue, and aid decision making in marketing management. The proposed method provides a data-driven alternative to traditional confirmatory methods in analyzing relations among given constructs. Its flexibility enables the business researcher to broaden the scope of research he/she can fruitfully engage in. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Three web diaries including notes from a period longer than one year were analysed inductively. That is, the research questions were approached data driven. Findings: Three themes showing the cultural meanings of dieting body were identified: ""towards a better body"", ""the ashamed body"" and ""back into control"". Moreover, two themes address the negotiating with the contradictory meanings of identity. They were labeled as ""from invisible to visible"" and ""the humanlike scales"". The identified themes were further analysed in relation to previous findings presented by Thompson and Hirschman in their analysis of consumers' experiences of their embodied selves. Originality/value: Little attention has been paid to dieting in previous cultural consumption studies even though meanings body and identity and their intertwining have been addressed. As the present findings are based on the naturally occurring data, they offer new ways to understand the meanings related to dieting. Maintaining the body project seems to be the project of becoming something (better) and therefore it asks the consumer to negotiate continuously with her body and identity. Consequently, the paper brings forth social and marketing implications that are developed on the grounds of findings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This privacy regulation restricted advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. We find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries. The loss in effectiveness was more pronounced for websites that had general content (such as news sites), where non-data-driven targeting is particularly hard to do. The loss of effectiveness was also more pronounced for ads with a smaller presence on the webpage and for ads that did not have additional interactive, video, or audio features. © 2011 INFORMS."

Any concern or doubt about the integrity or quality of clinical data, compliance with GCP, or ethical standards during regulatory review can lead to costly delays in the granting of a marketing authorization. This risk can be minimized if accurate metrics are used to continually monitor the quality of the contributing research operations. As highly cost-effective tools, metrics can be used to monitor operations throughout this phase of development. With continuous monitoring, proactive measures can be implemented to prevent issues from escalating into regulatory concerns.

50849112425,A system dynamics model as a decision aid in evaluating and communicating complex market entry strategies,Otto P.,Journal of Business Research,2008-11-01,10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.11.013,14,School of Management,Article,"Developing a market entry strategy is a critical activity for any firm but all the more so for those firms that wish to successfully compete in today's challenging global economy. Unfortunately, developing a market entry strategy is an ill-structured and complex activity for which structured approaches have proven inadequate. In less structured situations, data driven and model based decision-support systems (DSS) have been shown to be of significant help to decision-makers faced with such tasks. Getting managers to use such systems, however, is a major challenge that has been the subject of considerable research in the field of DSS. As far back as the 1970's scholars identified reasons why managers are reluctant to use such systems. Among the most often cited reasons why managers are reluctant to use these systems are: they do not understand the model inherent in the DSS; they do not know when to use them; they are unable to extend the use of the DSS; or they are unable to explain the model or its output to others. This paper describes the process of building a system dynamics model that can be employed by marketing managers to help them test the effectiveness of different market entry strategies, and equally important to help them to explain the system's logic and output. The model was built in a bottom-up fashion with the help of a team of marketing managers. In this way the team that helped build the model not only felt a sense of ownership concerning the model, but were also be able to better explain and defend their proposed strategy. © 2008."

Yet the range of measures proposed to reduce the environmental footprints of tourists at a destination remains limited to measures taken at the destination, as opposed to marketing measures which aim to attract truly green tourists. The potential of using green tourists as a market segment, however, has not been established. We review published profiles of green tourists and assess the managerial usefulness of this segment using theoretical criteria of segment attractiveness. Results indicate that much is known about the distinctive characteristics of green tourists. Very little, however, has been done to assess whether green tourists are substantial enough to represent a useful target market, whether a customized marketing mix can be designed, whether they can be reached through specific communication channels and whether green tourists can be identified repeatedly. These results provide a clear direction for future research into the green tourist market segment, which is essential for a marketing-oriented approach to sustainable tourism to be successful. © 2008 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

In this article we provide a set of frameworks grounded in the cross-disciplinary literature in information systems, strategy and marketing, to conceptualize what data-driven initiatives will align best with different firm strategies and value propositions. The first framework enables a disciplined industry analysis by enabling joint evaluation of the theoretical repurchase rate, degree of customizability of products and services, and degree of unobtrusive data capture that characterizes a given firm’s value proposition. The analysis then moves to the individual initiative’s level and offers guidance as to how to identify and prioritize these specific data-driven initiatives. This process starts with identifying the key transaction processing systems in the organization and inventorying the data they capture and store. After envisioning possible initiatives that leverage these data, the methodology suggests a way to prioritize projects to ensure that only those offering positive returns are implemented. A case analysis is used to illustrate the use of the proposed frameworks. © 2008 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved."

Explanatory models of multicategory choice behavior explicitly allow for such category purchase dependencies. They typically estimate own and across-category effects of marketing-mix variables on purchase incidences for a predefined set of product categories. Because of analytical restrictions, however, multicategory choice models can only handle a small number of categories. Hence, for large retail assortments, the issue emerges of how to determine the composition of shopping baskets with a meaningful selection of categories. Traditionally, this is resolved by managerial intuition. In this article, we combine multicategory choice models with a data-driven approach for basket selection. The proposed procedure also accounts for customer heterogeneity and thus can serve as a viable tool for designing target marketing programs. A data compression step first derives a set of basket prototypes which are representative for classes of market baskets with internally more distinctive (complementary) cross-category interdependencies and are responsible for the segmentation of households. In a second step, segment-specific cross-category effects are estimated for suitably selected categories using a multivariate logistic modeling framework. In an empirical illustration, significant differences in cross-effects and price elasticities can be shown both across segments and compared to the aggregate model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To seek a full reconciliation between industry and hospital pharmacists might be productive for industry, but it would certainly have long-term negative consequences for pharmacy and pharmacists."

In particular, the importance element of the importance-performance tool, common in performance measurement, is utilized to identify customer segments, which are then useful for marketing purposes. Based on 23,329 customers’ perceived importance of service quality, the analysis identifies four distinct customer segments with different priorities on six service quality dimensions. The demographic and participation profiles of these segments are also examined. The results demonstrate that over 60% of customers are more concerned about the physical evidence. In addition, facilities that aim to increase the access of older, female or unemployed customers need to realize that they are more critical of the physical evidence. By contrast, those hoping to attract more adolescents or ethnic minorities should emphasize the non-physical evidence. © 2008 Taylor & Francis."

As the main source of data, the authors use interviews of the case company’s managers. The findings suggest that the managers became motivated to adopt various management practices of corporate branding, related to (1) managing the brand hierarchy of the brand portfolio, (2) having corporate name dominance in association to product brands, mills, sales offices, etc and (3) defining and communicating aspirational corporate brand image values. The management goals behind adopting these corporate branding practices were related not only to customers but also to investors and investment analysts, potential employees, and own employees and managers.

The case under study in this paper is the Swiss travelling population, whose consumption behaviour can be characterised as mature. Methodologically, a combined two-step market segmentation is applied, with Step 1 consisting of an a priori segmentation between subjects, assigning either low or high importance to the WWWas a source of information (hence forming two groups), and Step 2 consisting of an a posteriori data-driven segmentation on the basis of all other sources of information within each of the above groups. The information about the clusters is enhanced by a number of profile variables, both with regard to travel situations as well as socio-demographic issues. The results reveal an alignment with earlier studies' findings: that travellers who assign a high importance to the WWW as a source of information tend to be younger and better educated, and they hold either good or very good professional positions or are currently undergoing training of some kind. However, the WWW turns out to be a complementary, rather than a substitutive, source of information; but this depends on the travel situation, such as when it is planned some time in advance, or when people prefer hotel-type accommodation. Printed brochures in combination with the WWW are quite important to people who have longer planning horizons, with more than one quarter of people using them, and when they plan a stay longer than one week. There is also a strong association between the WWW, travel guidebooks and information provided at the destination. © 2007 The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved."

The value of a project to a firm depends not only on its properties but also on the other projects being developed by the firm. This is due to interactions with the other projects that address the same consumer need and require the same development resources. In this study, we empirically investigate the structure and significance of these portfolio-level project interactions. Using a self-developed pharmaceutical industry data set, we conduct an event study around the failure of phase III clinical trials and their effect on the market valuation of the firm. The study exploits the natural experiment of a product development failure to give us a measure of the value of a drug development project to a firm. We then explain the variance in the value of projects based on interactions with other projects in the firm's portfolio. We find that the presence of other projects targeting the same market and a build-up of projects that require the same development resources reduce the value of a development project. In addition to providing evidence on the significance and structure of these portfolio-level project interactions, the empirical model estimated in this paper also provides a data-driven approach to valuing projects that may be relevant to licensing transactions. © 2007 INFORMS."

Psychographic heterogeneity among volunteers in Australia,Dolnicar S.,Voluntas,2007-01-01,10.1007/s11266-007-9037-5,76,University of Wollongong,Article,"Six psychographic segments of volunteers in Australia are constructed on the basis of their volunteering motivations. The resulting segments include ""classic volunteers,"" whose motivations are threefold: doing something worthwhile; personal satisfaction; and helping others. ""Dedicated volunteers"" perceive each one of the motives for volunteering as relevant, while ""personally involved volunteers"" donate time because of someone they know in the organization, most likely their child. ""Volunteers for personal satisfaction"" and ""altruists"" primarily wish to help others, and finally, ""niche volunteers"" typically have fewer and more specific drivers motivating them to donate time, for example, to gain work experience. The segments are externally validated and demonstrate significantly different socio-demographic profiles. Consequently, it seems that motivation-based data-driven market segmentation represents a useful way of gaining insight into heterogeneity amongst volunteers. Such insight can be used by volunteering organizations to more effectively target segments with customized messages. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Prior research has introduced ""active-learning"" policies for identifying data that are particularly useful for model induction, with the goal of decreasing the statistical error for a given acquisition cost (error-centric approaches). However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly. We also show that this method is robust in the face of decreasing quality of utility estimations, eventually converging to uniform random sampling, and that it can be extended to situations where different data acquisitions have different costs. The results suggest that businesses should consider modifying their strategies for acquiring information through normal business transactions. For example, a firm such as Amazon.com that models consumer preferences for customized marketing may accelerate learning by proactively offering recommendations - not merely to induce immediate sales, but for improving recommendations in the future. © 2007 INFORMS."

We utilize an inquiry model, which examines the enrollment decisions of students that have made contact with our institution, a medium sized, public, Doctoral I university. A student, who makes an inquiry to our university such as by returning a request for information form, often provides far less information than is available from applicants. Despite this fact we find that characteristics of the student, as well as geographic and demographic data based on the student's zip code are significant predictors of enrollment. Accounting for uncertainty in our model's specification, we find that we are able to predict out of sample the enrollment decision of 89% of student inquiries.

These tests are used to monitor the conditional variance of asset returns and to provide real-time information regarding instabilities or disruptions in financial risk. We discuss in detail the theoretical underpinnings of applying historical and sequential CUSUM change-point tests to monitor the stability of dynamic variance processes. Data-driven volatility monitoring schemes are investigated that satisfy the FCLT and provide various advantages for sequential analysis. We examine various issues that emerge when using such processes. One such issue is the sampling frequency since the processes can be sampled at alternative frequencies. We study the power of detection as sampling frequencies vary. Analytical relative local power results are obtained for the CUSUM test for monitoring volatility processes at low versus high sampling frequencies. The analytical results provide evidence of some nontrivial trade-offs between relative local power and the role of sampling frequency, persistence and tails of the volatility process. A comprehensive simulation analysis unfolds the finite sample properties of the CUSUM volatility change-point test and provides additional support to the analytical asymptotic results on relative local power. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The SNM campaigns are intended to correct misperceptions of subjective drinking norms and thereby drive down alcohol consumption. Method: Institutions of higher education were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. At the treatment group institutions, SNM campaigns delivered school-specific, data-driven messages through a mix of campus media venues. Cross-sectional student surveys were conducted by mail at baseline (n = 2,771) and at posttest 3 years later (n = 2,939). Hierarchical linear modeling was applied to examine multiple drinking outcomes, taking intraclass correlation into account. Results: Controlling for other predictors, having an SNM campaign was significantly associated with lower perceptions of student drinking levels and lower alcohol consumption, as measured by a composite drinking scale, recent maximum consumption, blood alcohol concentration for recent maximum consumption, drinks consumed when partying, and drinks consumed per week. A moderate mediating effect of normative perceptions on student drinking was demonstrated by an attenuation of the Experimental Group × Time interaction, ranging from 16.4% to 39.5% across measures. Additional models that took into account the intensity of SNM campaign activity at the treatment institutions suggested that there was a dose-response relationship. Conclusions: This study is the most rigorous evaluation of SNM campaigns conducted to date. Analysis revealed that students attending institutions that implemented an SNM campaign had a lower relative risk of alcohol consumption than students attending control group institutions."

Currently, it is believed that marketing planners are out of step with new customer behaviours growing out of the changing consumer technological environment. Left Brain Marketing Planning emphasises the need, opportunity and the means by which planners can adopt more analytical procedures to improve marketing planning by greater use of data-driven approaches that permit the selection and allocation of marketing resources based on an holistic picture of customers across all points in the buying process. Design/methodology/approach A two stage approach adopted by Forrester Research. First, a marketing allocation tool was devised using Forrester's Consumer Technographics® data to understand how consumers interact with 13 media. These were used to index each medium against four marketer inputs: business goals, target audience, product type, and targeting approach. Second, interviews were conducted with marketers and agencies to understand current marketing planning processes and best practices and their response to the marketing allocation tool. Interviews were also held with marketing planning experts for additional perspectives around how they anticipate marketing planning will change over the next five years. Findings Principally, current marketing planning processes are based on traditional approaches that take too little account of the new realities brought about by technological change. The media selected in the marketing planning process do not reflect the media habits of today's consumers. New technology has changed customer behaviour and new technology holds the means by which this can be monitored and evaluated to assess the effectiveness of marketing plans as they are implemented. Changes need to be made, and the means are at hand to achieve such changes, that allow more analytical approaches to marketing planning in understanding what is happening in today's marketplaces and not just an emphasis on marketing metrics for the purpose of meeting internal financial imperatives. Originality/value There is much debate about the dynamics in marketing planning between creative approaches and a greater emphasis on marketing metrics to ensure greater marketing accountability. This paper highlights the importance of analytical approaches that do not, of themselves, limit creativity. While encouraging the use of measurement and analytical tools, the paper emphasises the need to use these throughout the planning process and exploit the facilities enabled by new technology to assist in the process of better understanding consumers and communications and buying processes. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

Design/methodology/approach - In a unified, two-stage approach, a stochastic frontier model is first estimated and subsequently deviations from the demand frontier are regressed on customer characteristics. The method is illustrated in scanner panel data. Findings - A frontier demand function estimated in scanner data of a frequently-bought food category has significant and consistent parameters. Specific descriptor variables can explain excessive category demand and profile customers with considerable sales potential. Research limitations/implications - More work is needed to generalise the usefulness of the proposed model in different food categories. Future research may employ alternative functional specifications and explanatory variables. Practical implications - The empirical identification of salient characteristics improves consumer understanding and can assist in the design of data-driven marketing action. Applied researchers can use marketing and demographic variables that are found in standard consumer panels to estimate frontier models. Originality/value - The paper introduces stochastic frontier analysis as a means to determine consumer differences in food demand.

All rights reserved.Data-driven segmentation has become standard practice in strategic marketing. Typically, however, respondents are grouped only once, implicitly assuming deterministic nature of the segmentation methods applied. Once the segments are derived, background variables are used to test the significance of the difference between clusters indicating external validity of the market segments. High external validity implies a high level of trustworthiness of the solution and thus managerially useful market segments to choose from. However, single runs of explorative analysis remain only a weak basis for good long-term managerial decisions. in this study a different approach is suggested to improve the quality of the market structure insight for decision-making: Two data-driven segmentation solutions are constructed independently. Association between them is used as an additional internal validity indicator.Benefit and behavioural segmentation bases are used to illustrate the concept: Surfers provided information regarding the importance of aspects of proposed surf destinations and destinations they had previously visited. Segments resulting from both bases are profiled: They notably differ in background information. Significant association between these solutions supports the validity and managerial usefulness for target segment choice for the following targeted marketing action.Using this procedure results in the identification of stable consumer groups, which in turn leads to an improved understanding of customer segments; and thus enables the industry to improve the quality by customizing the product."

We provide chi-squared and t tests to assess the significance of each factor and its estimated coefficients, and we also generalize CIR to other inverse regression methods in situations where both dimension reduction and factor interpretation are important. Finally, we investigate CIR's small-sample performance, test data-driven constraints, and present a marketing example to illustrate its use in discovering meaningful factors that influence the desirability of brand logos. © 2005 American Statistical Association."

Building on the extant social exchange literature and incorporating recent work in the marketing domain, attraction in professional services is defined as the extent to which relational partners perceive past, current, future or potential partners as professionally appealing in terms of their ability to provide superior economic benefits, access to important resources and social compatibility. A conceptual model is developed that (1) posits the determinants of attraction as economic, social and resource-based, and (2) incorporates the proposed relationships between attraction, trust, commitment, interaction and accommodation/assimilation. The legal sector provides the context for the empirical research reported here. Specifically, the paper addresses relationships between barristers, solicitors and barristers' clerks. Findings on the determinants of attraction are presented and a data-driven model developed which substantially expands previous under-standings. This model presents the conditions for attraction, the lens through which attraction is viewed, and the elements of attraction. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications and directions for further research. © 2003, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved."
77953166359,Tracking data-driven market segments,Dolnicar S.,Tourism Analysis,2003-01-01,10.3727/108354203774076788,18,University of Wollongong,Article,"© 2004 Cognizant Comm. Corp.Market segmentation has become a standard concept in tourism marketing. A priori and a posteriori (data-driven) segmentation approaches enjoy high popularity among both practitioners and researchers. To optimize the market segmentation strategy it is not only necessary to identify relevant market segments, describe them, evaluate the match between corporate or destination strengths and segment needs, but also to determine how segments develop over time. This knowledge is typically accounted for when a priori segments are used. In the case of a posteriori segments, however, such trend tracking is neglected. In this article a tracking framework is presented that allows testing of a posteriori segment developments over time on the basis of identical consecutive guest surveys. The framework is flexible with regard to methods applied at each step and-through validation of explorative findings by means of repetition-allows insight into market structure from multiple perspectives."

0036895406,Business performance of surveying firms: A data-driven path model,Tay L.,Journal of Property Research,2002-12-01,10.1080/09599910210155509,4,National University of Singapore,Article,"Business performance is an important concern for all profit organizations including surveying firms. Based on the data from 179 UK surveying firms, a data-driven path analysis is conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of eight independent variables on business performance (the dependent variable). These are organization structure, environmental uncertainty, interconnectedness, size of firm, marketing performance, market orientation, management and strategy. The results suggest that only the marketing performance variable has a strong and significant direct effect on business performance. In turn, marketing performance is largely dependent on the firm's degree of market orientation. The finding in this study reinforces the postulation in existing literature that a market orientation is essential for sustaining competitive advantage in business firms. As such, the implication for surveying firms is that the stronger the market orientation of the firm, the better would be the business performance."

Hershey Medical Center,Article,"Background: Historically, academic health centers (AHCs) have detached themselves from commercialism and entrepreneurism, viewing these activities as being inconsistent with many of their core academic values. Word-of-mouth promotion was their primary, if not sole, marketing strategy. Less emphasis was placed on preparing, pricing, distributing, and promoting these services to targeted audiences. Understanding customers' needs was not a top priority. Methods: The marketing strategies and tools currently being developed and utilized by AHCs were reviewed. Results: In an effort to attract customers and win contracts, AHCs are aggressively marketing themselves by designing new services, promoting those services much more intensely, restructuring the entire distribution system that delivers those services, and crafting pricing strategies that build in flexibility. With growing frequency, these marketing tactics are part and parcel of a carefully crafted data-driven strategic plan designed to meet the business-development goals of the institution. Conclusions: In order to carry out their missions, AHCs have recognized that they can no longer rest on their ""ivory tower"" laurels. They must learn how to market themselves in a market economy. © 2001 Excerpta Medica, Inc."

In an empirical study using brands preferences derived from household panel data, we compare the SOM and TRN approach to MULTICLUS, a parametric latent vector multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) model approach which also simultaneously solves the market structuring and segmentation problem. Our empirical analysis shows several benefits and shortcomings of the three methodologies under investigation. As compared to MULTICLUS, we find that the non-parametric neural network approaches show a higher robustness against any kind of data preprocessing and a higher stability of partitioning results. As compared to SOM, we find advantages of TRN which uses a more flexible concept of adjacency structure. In TRN, no rigid grid of units must be prespecified. A further advantage of TRN lies in the possibility to exploit the information of the neighborhood graph for adjacent prototypes which supports ex-post decisions about the segment configuration at both the micro and the macro level. However, SOM and TRN also have some drawbacks as compared to MULTICLUS. The network approaches are, for instance, not directly accessible to inferential statistics. Our empirical study indicates that especially TRN may represent a useful expansion of the marketing analyst's tool box. Scope and purpose Determination of competitive market structure among rival brands and market segmentation represent well-known concepts in strategic marketing planning. During the last decade, approaches that combine the two interrelated tasks into one single model have been introduced into marketing literature. Most of them respect consumer heterogeneity by including 'fixed' parameters (e.g., demographic or past purchase behavior variables) for each individual or by assuming consumer parameters to be distributed according to a (mixture of) probability distribution(s). However, the key to the success of these statistical modeling approaches seems to lie in the proper choice of parametric model assumptions and/or heterogeneity distributions. Due to its non-parametric nature, the neuro-computing methodology presented in this article imposes less rigorous assumptions on data properties and derives segment-specific patterns of competitive relationships between brands in a purely data-driven way.

As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development. This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain. The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module. When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."

Data-driven modeling describes a process of model-building wherein models are created that fit the dynamics of the data rather than assuming a priori relationships among brands and their marketing mix elements. Based on a combination of time-series and econometric modeling methods, these models can significantly improve a modeler’s ability to capture marketplace structure and dynamics. Although more complex than their predecessors, the capabilities of these new data-driven decision support models make them potentially very powerful tools, improving intuition and managerial understanding while suggesting improved decision alternatives.

This paper describes an attempt to recast portfolio analysis in the light of past criticisms and the growing importance of expert systems to marketing decision making. It introduces a data driven approach to the analysis of competitive effects that has at its heart a portfolio-based model. Inputs to the ‘stratlogic’ model include data on the competitive structure of a product-market and measures of the marketing ambition and positioning of the players in it. The authors go on to outline the various steps that should be taken to develop an expert system based on the stratlogic approach. By deliberately exploiting management’s creativity and insight, the authors argue that the expert system approach facilitates the strategic thinking that would be constrained where a predefined set of general propositions was imposed. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
85009594601,Customer costs of service quality: A critical incident study,Youngdahl W.,Advances in Services Marketing and Management,1994-01-01,10.1016/S1067-5671(94)03017-0,10,,Article,"The involvement of customers in the production of service has led some researchers to suggest that customer costs should be explicitly considered when applying quality cost categories to service operations. Traditional quality cost categories of prevention, appraisal, internal failure and external failure capture companies' quality costs, but this classification may not account for the specific actions taken by customers in their quests for service satisfaction. Given the significance of customers' satisfaction-seeking behaviors to the fields of services marketing and management, this study derives categories of customer costs of service quality by employing the Critical Incident Technique. Specifically, customers reported their own satisfaction-seeking actions taken during service encounters. These actions were then categorized according to both the traditional cost of quality scheme and a new classification scheme that was determined by the actual data. Comparisons of the traditional categorization with the new data-driven classification provide insight into the nature of customers' efforts to obtain satisfaction. Some of these customer efforts, or customer costs of service quality, may help us gain a deeper understanding of the satisfaction assurance role that the customer plays in service co-production. Implications for research and practice are drawn from this insight. © 1994, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
